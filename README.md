# CyberOps Associate

All this files are contents from the cisco cyberops associate course from the netacad. As well, I've included some exercises and notes.

[The first chapter](./1.TheDanger.md) focus on an introduction of cybersecurity domain, describing about the threat actors, the security of IoT, threat impact, and three types of personal information.
[The second chapter](2.FirghtersInTheWarAgainstCybercrime.md) introduces elements of a SOC (security operations center) such as job roles, main processes, technologies. Additionally, the chapter introduces the concepts of security and availability, and an overview about how to become a defender.
