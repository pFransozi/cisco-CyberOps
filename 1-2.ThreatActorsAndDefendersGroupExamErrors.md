25 Question as presented: Match the SOC metric to the description. (Not all options are used.)

MTTC
MTTR
MTTD 
Dwell time

time required to stop the spread of malware in the network
time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
length of time that threat actors have access to a network before their access is stopped
average time to identify that valid security incidents have occurred in the network 
average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident

Dwell time -> length of time that threat actors have access to a network before their access is stopped;
MTTR -> average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident
MTTC -> time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
MTTD -> average time to identify that valid security incidents have occurred in the network
