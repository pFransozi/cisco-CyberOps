45 What is the result of an ARP poisoning attack?
Client information is stolen.

ARP poisoning is a technique used by an attacker to reply to an ARP request for an IPv4 address belonging to another device, such as the default gateway. The attacker, who is effectively doing an MITM attack, pretends to be the default gateway and sends an ARP reply to the transmitter of the ARP request. The receiver of the ARP reply will add the wrong MAC address to the ARP table and will send the packets to the attacker. Therefore, all traffic to the default gateway will funnel through the attacker device.
