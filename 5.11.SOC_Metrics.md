# SOC Metrics

## Introduction

Following the topics cover by Understanding Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Fundamentals v1.0 (200-201), in the section Security Policies and Procedures, the last topic is about the relationship of SOC metrics to scope analysis (time to detect, time to contain, time to respond, time to control).

Let's take a closer look at time to detect, time to contain, time to respond, time to control metrics.

## Detail

1. **time to detect or MTTD**, which is stand for mean time to detect, is the average time to detect (identify) and validate that a security incident (or intrusion) have occurred in the network.

2. **time to contain or MTTC**, which is stand for mean time to contain, is the average time a security professional within a SOC takes to stop an intrusion from causing further damage to data and other systems on the network.

3. **time to respond or MTTR**, which is stand for mean time to respond, is the average time to stop, control, remediate and eradicate an incident, which means return a system to operational condition after receiving notification of a failure or cyber attack.

4. **time to control** is the average time required to stop the spread of a malware in the network.

5. **dwell time** is the length of time that malicious actors have access to the network before detection and contention.

The three average metrics in all incidents consist of time to detect, understand and contain.
