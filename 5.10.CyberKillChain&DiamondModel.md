# Cyber Kill Chain Model

## Introduction

It is a model that represents the steps taken by an adversary to accomplish an intrusion, and it is referenced as a method to explain cyber intrusion activity. This model is composed by seven steps, which are: 1. reconnaissance, 2. weaponization, 3. delivery, 4. exploitation, 5. instalation, 6. command and control (C2 or CnC), 7. actions on objectives.

## Detail

Those seven steps represents the steps that a malicious actor takes through him intrusion process. Therefore, the goal for any incident management practice is to catch an attack as early in the kill chain as possible.

Further analysis of each step:

1. reconnaissance: it is research on a target and typically is the most time-consuming yet most rewarding step of the kill chain. **The main goal of this phase are** identify the targets, associations to the targets, and as much data as possibile about each target. The most valuable data is identified targets, applications, systems, available ports, running services, information about people, and documents. The first common place that is researched is the target's website, by which tons of information can be divulged. **An example if this is pulling up the robots.txt file of a website, which tells search engines what should and what should not be visible.** Another method for finding data is looking at an older version os a website using WayBack Machine found at http://archive.org/. Another place to find sensitive documents and information is the EDGAR database, which contains registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms of information on American-based companies since 1994. The end result of good reconnaissance should be a list of possible targets, with details regarding what software they running, open ports, available services, associated administrators, and so on. The adversary can select the best method for attack, thus moving things to the weaponization phase.

2. weaponization: in this phase, the attacker develop and test how the attack will be executed, from a vulnerability found during the reconnaissance stage matches a known exploit to use against it. Attacks that are executed in the real world are typically planned and tested before being launched against a target.

3. delivery:
