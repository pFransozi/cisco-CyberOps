# Cyber Kill Chain Model

Classify intrusion events into categories as defined by security models, such as **Cyber Kill Chain Model** and **Diamond Model of Intrusion**

## Introduction

It is a model that represents the steps taken by an adversary to accomplish an intrusion, and it is referenced as a method to explain cyber intrusion activity. This model is composed by seven steps, which are: 1. reconnaissance, 2. weaponization, 3. delivery, 4. exploitation, 5. instalation, 6. command and control (C2 or CnC), 7. actions on objectives.

**Diamond Model of Intrusion** is a trusted approach to categorizing and representing security incidents made up of four parts. Active intrusions start with an adversary who is targeting a victim, using various capabilities along some form of infrastructure.

## Kill Chain Detail 

These **seven steps represents the steps that a malicious actor takes through him intrusion process**. Therefore, the goal for any incident management practice is to catch an attack as early in the kill chain as possible.

Further analysis of each step:

**1. reconnaissance**: **it is all about gather information and typically is the most time-consuming yet most rewarding step of the kill chain**. **The main goal of this phase are** identify the targets, associations to the targets, and as much data as possible about each target. The most valuable data is identified targets, applications, systems, available ports, running services, information about people, and documents. The first common place that is researched is the target's website, by which tons of information can be divulged. **An example if this is pulling up the robots.txt file of a website, which tells search engines what should and what should not be visible.** Another method for finding data is looking at an older version os a website using WayBack Machine found at http://archive.org/. Another place to find sensitive documents and information is the EDGAR database, which contains registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms of information on American-based companies since 1994. The end result of good reconnaissance should be a list of possible targets, with details regarding what software they running, open ports, available services, associated administrators, and so on. The adversary can select the best method for attack, thus moving things to the weaponization phase.

**2. weaponization**: in this phase, the attacker develop and test how the attack will be executed, from a vulnerability found during the reconnaissance stage matches a known exploit to use against it. Attacks that are executed in the real world are typically planned and tested before being launched against a target.

**3. delivery**: delivering an attack can follow many steps and leverage a combination of physical, digital and social methods. As well many adversaries use a combination of delivery methods to sneak the payload over.

**4. exploitation**: it is the most challenging step of the kill chain defend because there are just too many things that can be vulnerable.Even though a security administrator perform a thorough assessment of the network, it is not sufficient because new ones could originate from a new user coming on the network. In summary, it is when an attack is delivered to a target and launched against a vulnerability. Typically something is delivered through the exploitation process.

**5. installation**: it tends to be an area that is overlooked by security operations teams because admins tend to by hyper-focused on avoiding exploitation using tools such as AV and IPS. The industry average for most organizations to identify a security breach takes anywhere from 100 to 200 days, giving an adversary plenty of time to accomplish the remaining steps of the kill chain. This phase is the installation of the previously developed weapon and persistency inside the target system or environment. Sometimes the attacker can access the network through a established communication channel.

**Note: All steps after the exploitations phaseThe adversary uses capabilities over infrastructure to attack the victim. The model can be interpreted as saying, “The adversary uses the infrastructure to connect to the victim. The adversary develops capability to exploit the victim.” For example, a capability like malware might be used over the email infrastructure by an adversary to exploit a victim.
**7. Action on Objectives**: it represents when an adversary is inside the network and starting to achieve the objective for launching the attack.

## Diamond Detail

Adversary: Hacktivist, threat actors, disgruntled employee, which seek to compromise and gain access to information data;

Victim: network assets, personas, devices, which in other words, are **targets**.

Capabilities: Malware, Exploits, Hacker Tools

Infrastructure: IP addresses, domain, email

As a cybersecurity analyst, you may be called on to use the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis to diagram a series of intrusion events. The Diamond Model is ideal for illustrating how the adversary pivots from one event to the next. 

Instances of the same event occurring over the course of a few weeks **could be linked together through multiple diamonds and then linked back to the same adversary**. Linking the spear-phishing attack to the delivery of ransomware can give an analyst a method to diagram the attack and all associated adversaries. The incident response team should create an activity group based on the various connected diamonds and attempt to define what combinations of elements are criteria for grouping diamonds together. As new diamonds appear, activity groups can grow as diamonds are grouped together based on newly available data.
