# Host-Based Analysis

## Examining Network Sercurity Data

### Cyber attribution

Cyber or threat attribution is determining who is responsible for a cyberattack.

Cyber attribution is piecing together events that take place after discovering a cyber attack. Part of that process is:

1. a digital forensic action to gather evidences to determines the threat actors involved along with possible motives.

Investigate the cyberattack means:

1. identify threats actors and report them to the authorities
2. provide evidence to support prosecution
3. protect the organization
4. prevent future incidents and/or cybercrime

In a SOC, the analysts are often the first to uncorver malicious activity or a cyberattack

### Outline the digital forensic investigation

Digital forensics is the recovery and investigation of information found on digital devices as it relates to criminal activity.

Digital forensics process>

     Media --> Data        --> Information --> Evidence
Collection --> Examination --> Analysis    --> Reporting

Collection is identification of potential sources of forensic data
Examination is assessing and extracting relevant information
Analysis is drawing conclusions from the data
Reporting is preparing and presenting information

### Compare different types of evidence

Collecting evidence:

1. computer memory, packet captures, log files
2. properly preserve the evidence for future analysis

Classifying evidences:

direct evidence:

1. indisputably establishes a particular fact
    a. security camera showing a person breaking into a store and stealing items

indirect evidence

1. establishes a hypothesis in combination with other facts
    a. it is also known as circumstantial evidence
2. can be used to support a conclusion of fact
    a. such as a fingerprint found at the scene of a crime

best evidence: this evidence could be storage devices used by an accused, or archives of files that can be proven to be unaltered.

corroborating evidence

1. supports an assertion that is developed from best evidence
    a. for example, a witness saw the accused crach into a red fire truck
    b. later on, another witness testified that they examined the accused car and it had red paint on the bumper.

### Preserve the chain of custody

Properly handling evidence:

1. the cyberattack mught be classified as a cybercrime
2. anyone involved in collecting evidence must properly handle the evidence at every step

Chain of Custody: documentation that outlines how the evidence was handled. And can include:

1. description of the evidence and where it was obtained
2. the name of the individual that collected the evidence
3. the date and time the evidence changed custody

Follow proper procedure

Determine possible insider attack

Collect evidences must follow RFC 3227:

order of digital evidence collection from most volatile (contents of ram) to least volatile (archived backup data).

Best practice:

1. do not disconnect, unplug, or turn off affected machines
2. presenve all timestamps of any affected data
3. never alter the original evidence
4. adhering to the chain of custody will ensure that any evidence is properly preserved.
