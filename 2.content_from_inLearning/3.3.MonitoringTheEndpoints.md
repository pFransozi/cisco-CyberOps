# Host-Based Analysis
## Monitoring the endpoints

### Outline the network architecture

Network design can influence the data flow and how security appliances and sertices such as SNMP and NetFlow can monitor and help secure the network.

### Provide defense in depth

### Simple Network Management Protocol

SNMP gathers and reports information on the status of network devices.

Main components:

1. SNMP manager or the network management server
2. Managed devices such as workstations, printers, and routers
3. SNMP agent collects data from the device and stores it in a local management information base (MIB)
4. MIB is where the agent's references are stored in a hierarchy format.

SNMP commands:

get: requests the value of a specific object id (OID)
response: to get a message
getnext: requests the next sequential object in the MIB
set: sent by a manager to an agent to change a value
getbulk: multiple getnext requests
trap: notifications of events on the managed device
inform: confirm the manager has received a trap

### Understand NTP

Accurate time on a network is very important and many protocols and processes require synchronized time on the network.

iOS cisco has a hardware battery powered time, additionally it has a software primary source for time that can be:

1. network time protocol (NTP)
2. simple network time protocol (SNTP)
3. VINES time service
4. Manual configuration
