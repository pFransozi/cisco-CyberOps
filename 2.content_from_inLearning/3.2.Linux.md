* SIEM systems: real-time analysis or alerts
* ticketing systems: manage tasks in a SOC

### Use the Linux file system

Common file systems

* ext2: commonly used for flash-based storage media because it minimizes the number of writes
* ext3: added a journal or log that is used to minimize the risk of corrupting the file system in case of a power loss.
* ext4: offers improved performance and addtional features.

Common subdirectories:

* /bin : common programs shared by the system, the system administrator, and the users
* /home : home directories of the common users
* /proc : contains information about system resource
* /var : stores variable and temporary files created by users

Permission groups

* owner : permissions apply only to the owner of the file or directory
* group : permissions apply only to the group that has been assigned to the file or directory and no other users
* other : apply to all others on the system.

Permission types:

* read
