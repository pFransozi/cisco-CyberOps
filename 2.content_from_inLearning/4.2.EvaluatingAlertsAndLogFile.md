# Evaluating Alerts and Log Files

## Being application aware

## Evaluating antivirus alerts

Many attacks originate from inside the network. An internal host can be a starting point for an attacker to gain access to critical system devices.

Methods to detect malware can include:

* signature based
* heuristics based
* behavior based

Host and network defenses:

* host based runs on every protected machine and include host-based firewalls and security suites
* network-based malware protection can share information to make better-informed decisions.

## Viewing web proxy logs

Defending the network

* AMP: Advanced malware protection, which protects from viruses and malware
* ESA: Email security appliance, which provides filtering of spams and potentially malicious emails
* WSA: Web Security Appliance, which provides filtering of websites and blacklisting
* NAC: Network admission control, which permits only authorized and compliance systems to connect to network.
