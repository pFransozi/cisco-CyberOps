# Handling Incidents

## Understanding incidents

Incidents and events are any observable occurrence in a system or network.

Difference between Incident and Disaster

Incident is generally unplanned and it disrupts day-to-day activities.
Disaster is a large scale and it involves multiple agencies. And recovery can take weeks or months.

Managing incidents is an important concept because an incident can evolve to a disaster.

## Managing incidents

* respond quickly to prevent an escalation of the problem
* begins as soon as an incident is reported
* continues monitoring until operations have resumed normal activity

## Preparing for an incident

* Stay current with patches and updates
* Maintain an inventory of replacement hardware
* store known good images
* install network security tools
* prepare dedicated forensics workstations
* gather contact information

## Detecting incidents

* Expanded attack surface
* automated detection capabilities include: network-based and host-based IDPs, antimalware protection, and log analyzers.
* A challenge is how to analyze the huge amount of data.
