## Security Monitoring

### Comparing Data Types Used in Security Monitoring

Types of alerms:

1. False positive: occurs when processing benign traffic
2. False negative: occurs when processing attack traffic that the intrusion system is configured to detect, which means fails to generate an alarm for known attacks.
3. True positive: a response to known malicious traffic
4. normal traffic does not generate an alarm.

Goals:

1. Generate true positive alarms
2. Minimize false positives and false negatives
3. Study existing traffic
4. Tune signatures

**An IDS works by monitoring the network traffic** to evalute if any activity matches the rule set, **which can indicate a possible intrusion**.
