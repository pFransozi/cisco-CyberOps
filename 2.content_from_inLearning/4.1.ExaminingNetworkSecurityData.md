# Host-Based Analysis

## Examining Network Sercurity Data

### Understand data types used in security monitoring

Devices on a network collect data and then use telemetry to transmit to central devices to monitor and analyze the data.

Alerts message are generated by IPS or IDS when traffic violates a rule or matches the signature of a known exploit.

### Generate a malware analysis report


### Compare HIDS with NIDS

1. Intrusion detection systems enforce policies on what traffic is allowed and what is denied
2. can be host based or network based
    a. host based monitors a single host
    b. network based monitors the entire netowrk.

Host-based intrusion detection:

1. can be fine-tuned to the specific workflow or user role
2. OS specific and works independently
    a. decrypts traffic

Network-based intrusion detection

1. contain numerous components
    sensors or agents, state tables, and signature databases
2. operating system independent
3. visualize attacks occuring acros the network

Disadvantages of NIDS

1. excessive growth and increased bandwidth usage influences the ability to capture and analyze all traffic
2. additional network sensors are needed, increasing overall costs
3. cannot monitor encrypted traffic
4. fragmentation also causes issues

NIDS devices

1. stand-alone device
2. integrated with a router
3. ASA

NIDS Components

Host-based IDSs monitor a single host or end point, and network-based IDSs monitor malicious and unauthorized activity on the network.

### Use a sandbox to evaluate malicious activity
