# Identify Endpoint Vulnerabilities

## Understanding network profiling

### critical asset address space

* represents the IP addresses and subnetworks of essential systems or data stores
* devices can be tuned to monitor inbound and outbound traffic from this logical location

## Profiling server behavior

### Server profiling

* Create a baseline of server activity during its normal operating state
* changes to normal behavior can be more easily identified

System infected with malware opens ports to establish a connection with remote servers and attempts to spread malware on the network; once the abnormal activity is identified, this can help provide an IoC (indicator of compromise) on the server.

server profiling:

* using file integrity, checking software on hosts
* monitor the average and peak usage levels
* listening ports, 80, 443
* logged in users and service accounts, checking for unauthorized logins
