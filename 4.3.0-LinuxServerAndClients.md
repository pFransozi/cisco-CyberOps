## 4.3.0 Linux Server and clients

### 4.3.1 An introduction to client-server communications

**Servers are** computers with software installed that enables them **to provide services to clients across the network**. Some provide external resources such as files, email messages, or web pages to clients upon request. Other services run maintenance tasks such as log management, memory management, disk scanning, and more. Each service requires separate server software.

### 4.3.2 Servers, services, and their ports

In order that a computer **can be the server for multiple services**, **ports are used**. **A port is a reserved network resource used by a service. A server is said to be “listening” on a port when it has associated itself to that port.**

**While the administrator can decide which port to use with any given service**, **many clients are configured to use a specific port by default**. **It is common practice to leave the service running in its default port**.

|Port   |Description|
|-------|-----------|
|20/21  |File Transfer Protocol (FTP) |
|22     |Secure Shell (SSH) |
|23     |Telnet remote login service |
|25     |Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) |
|53     |Domain Name System (DNS) |
|67/68  |Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)|
|69     |Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)|
|80     |Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)|
|110    |Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) |
|123    |Network Time Protocol (NTP) |
|143    |Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) |
|161/162|Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) |
|443    |HTTP Secure (HTTPS)|

### 4.3.3 Clients

Clients are programs or applications designed to communicate with a specific type of server. Also known as client applications, clients use a well-defined protocol to communicate with the server. Web browsers are web clients that are used to communicate with web servers through the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on port 80. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client is software used to communicate with an FTP server.

## 4.4.0 Basic server administrations

### 4.4.1 Service configuration files

In Linux, **services are managed using configuration files**. Common options in configuration files are port number, location of the hosted resources, and client authorization details. **When the service starts**, it looks for its configuration files, loads them into memory, and adjusts itself according to the settings in the files. Configuration file modifications often require restarting the service before the changes take effect.

### 4.4.2 Hardening devices

Device hardening involves implementing proven methods of securing the device and protecting its administrative access. Some of these methods involve maintaining passwords, configuring enhanced remote login features, and implementing secure login with SSH. Defining administrative roles in terms of access is another important aspect of securing infrastructure devices because not all information technology personnel should have the same level of access to the infrastructure devices.

**Depending on the Linux distribution, many services are enabled by default. Some of these features are enabled for historical reasons but are no longer required. Stopping such services and ensuring they do not automatically start at boot time is another device hardening technique.**

**OS updates are also extremely important to maintaining a hardened device. New vulnerabilities are discovered every day. OS developers create and issue fixes and patches regularly. An up-to-date computer is less likely to be compromised.**

The following are basic best practices for device hardening:

* Ensure physical security
* Minimize installed packages
* Disable unused services
* Use SSH and disable the root account login over SSH
* Keep the system updated
* Disable USB auto-detection
* Enforce strong passwords
* Force periodic password changes
* Keep users from re-using old passwords

Many other steps exist and are often service or application-dependent.

### 4.4.3 Monitoring service logs

**Log files are the records that a computer stores to keep track of important events**. **Kernel, services, and application events are all recorded in log files**. **It is very important for an administrator to periodically review the logs of a computer to keep it healthy**. By monitoring Linux log files, an administrator gains **a clear picture of the computer’s performance, security status, and any underlying issues**. Log file analysis allows an administrator to guard against upcoming issues before they occur.

In Linux, log files can be categorized as:
* Application logs
* Event logs
* Service logs
* System logs

**Some logs contain information about daemons that are running in the Linux system**. **A daemon is a background process that runs without the need for user interaction**. For example, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) manages remote access and authentication for single sign-on capabilities.

**Big picture about logs**

1. /var/log/messages
    * This directory contains generic computer activity logs
    * It is mainly used to store informational and non-critical system messages
    * In Debian-based computers, /var/log/syslog directory serves the same purpose
1. /var/log/auth.log
    * This file stores all authentication-related events in Debian and Ubuntu computers
    * Anything involving the user authorization mechanism can be found in this file
1. /var/log/secure
    * This directory is used by RedHat and CentOS computers instead of /var/log/auth.log
    * It also tracks sudo logins, SSH logins, and other errors logged by SSSD
1. /var/log/boot.log
    *  This file stores boot-related information and messages logged during the computer startup process
1. /var/log/dmesg
    * This directory contains kernel ring buffer messages
    * Information related to hardware devices and their drivers is recorded here
    * It is very important because, due to their low-level nature, logging systems such as syslog are not running when these events take place and therefore are often unavailable to the administrator in real-time
1. /var/log/kern.log
    * This file contains information logged by the kernel
1. /var/log/cron
    * Cron is a service used to schedule automated tasks in Linux and this directory stores its events
    * Whenever a scheduled task (also called a cron job) runs, all its relevant information including execution status and error messages are stored here
1. /var/log/mysqld.log or /var/log/mysql.log
    * This is the MySQL log file
    * All debug, failure and success messages related to the mysqld process and mysqld_safe daemon are logged here
    * RedHat, CentOS and Fedora Linux distributions store MySQL logs under /var/log/mysqld.log, while Debian and Ubuntu maintain the log in /var/log/mysql.log file
