9. A user creates a file with .ps1 extension in Windows. What type of file is it? 
    PowerShell script 
    The types of commands that PowerShell can execute include the following:

    cmdlets - perform an action and return an output or object to the next command that will be executed
    PowerShell scripts - files with a .ps1 extension that contain PowerShell commands that are executed
    PowerShell functions - pieces of code that can be referenced in a script

10.  What is the purpose of using the net accounts command in Windows?
    to review the settings of password and logon requirements for users 
    These are some common net commands:

    net accounts – sets password and logon requirements for users
    net start – starts a network service or lists running network services
    net use – connects, disconnects, and displays information about shared network resources
    net view – shows a list of computers and network devices on the network

    When used without options, the net accounts command displays the current settings for password, logon limitations, and domain information.

13. A PC user issues the netstat command without any options. What is displayed as the result of this command?
    a list of all established active TCP connections
    When used by itself (without any options), the netstat command will display all the active TCP connections that are available.

25. Match the commonly used ports on a Linux server with the corresponding service. (Not all options are used.)
    SMTP - 25
    DNS - 53
    HTTPS - 443
    SSH - 
    TELNET - 23

27.  Which two methods can be used to harden a computing device? (Choose two.) 
    Enforce the password history mechanism. 
    Ensure physical security.

The basic best practices for device hardening are as follows:

    Ensure physical security.
    Minimize installed packages.
    Disable unused services.
    Use SSH and disable the root account login over SSH.
    Keep the system updated.
    Disable USB auto-detection.
    Enforce strong passwords.
    Force periodic password changes.
    Keep users from reusing old passwords.
    Review logs regularly.

29.  Consider the result of the ls -l command in the Linux output below. What are the file permissions assigned to the sales user for the analyst.txt file? 

    ls –l analyst.txt
-rwxrw-r-- sales staff 1028 May 28 15:50 analyst.txt 
    
    read, write, execute
    The file permissions are always displayed in the User, Group and Other order. In the example displayed, the file has the following permissions:

    The dash ( - ) means that this is a file. For directories, the first dash would replaced with a "d".
    The first set of characters is for user permission (rwx). The user, sales, who owns the file can read, write and execute the file.
    The second set of characters is for group permissions (rw-). The group, staff, who owns the file can read and write to the file.
    The third set of characters is for any other user or group permissions (r--). Any other user or group on the computer can only read the file.

30 Which user can override file permissions on a Linux computer? 
    root user 

    A user has as much rights to a file as the file permissions allow. The only user that can override file permission on a Linux computer is the root user. Because the root user has the power to override file permissions, the root user can write to any file. 

33 What are two benefits of using an ext4 partition instead of ext3? (Choose two.) 
    increase in the size of supported files
    improved performance 

    Based on the ex3 file system, an ext4 partition includes extensions that improve performance and an increase in the of supported files. An ext4 partition also supports journaling, a file system feature that minimizes the risk of file system corruption if power is suddenly lost to the system. 


# Second shot

5 Match the Windows 10 boot sequence after the boot manager (bootmgr.exe) loads.

Step one: The windows boot loader Winload.exe loads.
Step two: Ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll are loaded.
Step three: Winload.exe reads the Registry, chooses a hardware prpfile, and loads the device drivers
Step four: Ntoskrnl.exe takes over the process.
Step five: Winlogon.exe is loaded and executes the logon process.
