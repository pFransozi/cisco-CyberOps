# Digital Forensics and Incident Analysis and Response

## Evidence Handling and Attack Attribution

### Digital Forensics

The **cybersecurity analyst will inevitably uncover evidence of criminal activity**. In order to protect the organization and to prevent cybercrime, it is necessary to identify threat actors, report them to the appropriate authorities, and provide evidence to support prosecution. **Tier 1 cybersecurity analysts are often the first to uncover wrongdoing**. Cybersecurity analysts must know how to properly handle evidence and attribute it to threat actors.

**Digital forensics is the recovery and investigation of information found on digital devices as it relates to criminal activity**. Indicators of compromise are the evidence that a cybersecurity incident has occurred. This information could be data on storage devices, in volatile computer memory, or the traces of cybercrime that are preserved in network data, such as pcaps and logs. It is essential that all indicators of compromise be preserved for future analysis and attack attribution.

**Cybercriminal activity can be broadly characterized as originating from inside of or outside of the organization**. Private investigations are concerned with individuals inside the organization. These individuals could simply be behaving in ways that violate user agreements or other non-criminal conduct. When individuals are suspected of involvement in criminal activity involving the theft or destruction of intellectual property, an organization may choose to involve law enforcement authorities, in which case the investigation becomes public. Internal users could also have used the organization’s network to conduct other criminal activities that are unrelated to the organizational mission but are in violation of various legal statutes. In this case, public officials will carry out the investigation.

When an external attacker has exploited a network and stolen or altered data, evidence needs to be gathered to document the scope of the exploit. Various regulatory bodies specify a range of actions that an organization must take when various types of data have been compromised. The results of forensic investigation can help to identify the actions that need to be taken.

For example, under the US HIPAA regulations, if a data breach has occurred that involves patient information, notification of the breach must be made to the affected individuals. If the breach involves more than 500 individuals in a state or jurisdiction, the media, as well as the affected individuals, must be notified. Digital forensic investigation must be used to determine which individuals were affected, and to certify the number of affected individuals so that appropriate notification can be made in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

It is possible that the organization itself could be the subject of an investigation. Cybersecurity analysts may find themselves in direct contact with digital forensic evidence that details the conduct of members of the organization. Analysts must know the requirements regarding the preservation and handling of such evidence. Failure to do so could result in criminal penalties for the organization and even the cybersecurity analyst if the intention to destroy evidence is established.

### The Digital Forensics Process

It is important that an organization develop well-documented processes and procedures for digital forensic analysis. Regulatory compliance may require this documentation, and this documentation may be inspected by authorities in the event of a public investigation.

**NIST Special Publication 800-86** Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response is a valuable resource for organizations that require guidance in developing digital forensics plans.For example, it recommends that forensics be performed using the four-phase process.

The following describes the four basic phases of the digital evidence forensic process.

Media --> Data --> Information --> Evidence

Collection --> Examination --> Analysis --> Reporting
    |------------------------------------------| the process is continuos

Collection: This is the identification of potential sources of forensic data and acquisition, handling, and storage of that data. This stage is critical because special care must be taken not to damage, lose, or omit important data.

Examination: This entails assessing and extracting relevant information from the collected data. This may involve decompression or decryption of the data. Information that is irrelevant to the investigation may need to be removed. Identifying actual evidence in large collections of data can be very difficult and time-consuming.

Analysis: This entails drawing conclusions from the data. Salient features, such as people, places, times, events, and so on should be documented. This step may also involve the correlation of data from multiple sources.

Reporting: This entails preparing and presenting information that resulted from the analysis. Reporting should be impartial and alternative explanations should be offered if appropriate. Limitations of the analysis and problems encountered should be included. Suggestions for further investigation and next steps should also be made.

4. Which technique includes preparation and presentation of the information which resulted from the analysis? reporting

## Types of Evidence

In legal proceedings, evidence is broadly classified as either direct or indirect. Direct evidence is evidence that was indisputably in the possession of the accused, or is eyewitness evidence from someone who directly observed criminal behavior.

Evidence is further classified as:

Best evidence - This is evidence that is in its original state. This evidence could be storage devices used by an accused, or archives of files that can be proven to be unaltered.
Corroborating evidence - This is evidence that supports an assertion that is developed from best evidence.
Indirect evidence - This is evidence that, in combination with other facts, establishes a hypothesis. This is also known as circumstantial evidence. For example, evidence that an individual has committed similar crimes can support the assertion that the person committed the crime of which they are accused.

### Check Your Understanding - Identify the Type of Evidence

1. Which type of evidence was indisputably in the possession of the accused? direct evidence

2. Which type of evidence supports an assertation that is developed from best evidence? corroborating evidence

3. Which type of evidence is circumstantial evidence that, in combination with other facts, establishes a hypothesis? indirect evidence

4. Which type of evidence is in its original state? best evidence

## Evidence Collection Order

IETF RFC 3227 provides guidelines for the collection of digital evidence. It describes an order for the collection of digital evidence based on the volatility of the data. Data stored in RAM is the most volatile, and it will be lost when the device is turned off. In addition, important data in volatile memory could be overwritten by routine machine processes. Therefore, the collection of digital evidence should begin with the most volatile evidence and proceed to the least volatile, as shown in the figure.

### Evidence Collection Priority

Volatile        ----------->        Non-volalile
Contents        Contents of         Archived Backup
of RAM          Fixed Disks         Data

An example of most volatile to least volatile evidence collection order is as follows:

1. Memory registers, caches
2. Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics, RAM
3. Temporary file systems
4. Non-volatile media, fixed and removable
5. Remote logging and monitoring data
6.Physical interconnections and topologies
7. Archival media, tape or other backups

Details of the systems from which the evidence was collected, including who has access to those systems and at what level of permissions should be recorded. Such details should include hardware and software configurations for the systems from which the data was obtained.

### Chain of Custody

Although evidence may have been gathered from sources that support attribution to an accused individual, it can be argued that the evidence could have been altered or fabricated after it was collected. In order to counter this argument, a rigorous chain of custody must be defined and followed.

Chain of custody involves the collection, handling, and secure storage of evidence. Detailed records should be kept of the following:

* Who discovered and collected the evidence?
* All details about the handling of evidence including times, places, and personnel involved.
* Who has primary responsibility for the evidence, when responsibility was assigned, and when custody changed?
* Who has physical access to the evidence while it was stored? Access should be restricted to only the most essential personnel.

### Data Integrity and Preservation

When collecting data, it is important that it is preserved in its original condition. Timestamping of files should be preserved. For this reason, the original evidence should be copied, and analysis should only be conducted on copies of the original. This is to avoid accidental loss or alteration of the evidence. Because timestamps may be part of the evidence, opening files from the original media should be avoided.

The process used to create copies of the evidence that is used in the investigation should be recorded. Whenever possible, the copies should be direct bit-level copies of the original storage volumes. It should be possible to compare the archived disc image and the investigated disk image to identify whether the contents of the investigated disk have been tampered with. For this reason, it is important to archive and protect the original disk to keep it in its original, untampered with, condition.

Volatile memory could contain forensic evidence, so special tools should be used to preserve that evidence before the device is shut down and evidence is lost. Users should not disconnect, unplug, or turn off infected machines unless explicitly told to do so by security personnel.

Following these processes will ensure that any evidence of wrongdoing will be preserved, and any indicators of compromise can be identified.

### Attack Attribution

After the extent of the cyberattack has been assessed and evidence collected and preserved, incident response can move to identifying the source of the attack. As we know, a wide range of threat actors exist, ranging from disgruntled individuals, hackers, cybercriminals and criminal gangs, or nation states. Some criminals act from inside the network, while others can be on the other side of world. Sophistication of cybercrime varies as well. Nation states may employ large groups of highly-trained individuals to carry out an attack and hide their tracks, while other threat actors may openly brag about their criminal activities.

Threat attribution refers to the act of determining the individual, organization, or nation responsible for a successful intrusion or attack incident.

Identifying responsible threat actors should occur through the principled and systematic investigation of the evidence. While it may be useful to also speculate as to the identity of threat actors by identifying potential motivations for an incident, it is important not to let this bias the investigation. For example, attributing an attack to a commercial competitor may lead the investigation away from the possibility that a criminal gang or nation state was responsible.

In an evidence-based investigation, the incident response team correlates Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) that were used in the incident with other known exploits. Cybercriminals, much like other criminals, have specific traits that are common to most of their crimes. Threat intelligence sources can help to map the TTP identified by an investigation to known sources of similar attacks. However, this highlights a problem with threat attribution. Evidence of cybercrime is seldom direct evidence. Identifying commonalities between TTPs for known and unknown threat actors is circumstantial evidence.

Some aspects of a threat that can aid in attribution are the location of originating hosts or domains, features of the code used in malware, the tools used, and other techniques. Sometimes, at the national security level, threats cannot be openly attributed because doing so would expose methods and capabilities that need to be protected.

For internal threats, asset management plays a major role. Uncovering the devices from which an attack was launched can lead directly to the threat actor. IP addresses, MAC addresses, and DHCP logs can help track the addresses used in the attack back to a specific device. AAA logs are very useful in this regard, as they track who accessed what network resources at what time.

### The MITRE ATT&CK Framework

One way to attribute an attack is to model threat actor behavior. The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) Framework enables the ability to detect attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) as part of threat defense and attack attribution. This is done by mapping the steps in an attack to a matrix of generalized tactics and describing the techniques that are used in each tactic. Tactics consist of the technical goals that an attacker must accomplish in order to execute an attack and techniques are the means by which the tactics are accomplished. Finally, procedures are the specific actions taken by threat actors in the techniques that have been identified. Procedures are the documented real-world use of techniques by threat actors.

The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a global knowledge base of threat actor behavior. It is based on observation and analysis of real-world exploits with the purpose of describing the behavior of the attacker, not the attack itself. It is designed to enable automated information sharing by defining data structures for the exchange of information between its community of users and MITRE.

The figure shows an analysis of a ransomware exploit from the excellent ANY.RUN online sandbox. The columns show the enterprise attack matrix tactics, with the techniques that are used by the malware arranged under the columns. Clicking the technique then lists details of the procedures that are used by the specific malware instance with a definition, explanation, and examples of the technique.

Note: Do an internet search on MITRE ATT&CK to learn more about tool.

## The Cyber Kill Chain

### Steps of the Cyber Kill Chain

The Cyber Kill Chain was developed by Lockheed Martin to identify and prevent cyber intrusions. There are seven steps to the Cyber Kill Chain. Focusing on these steps helps analysts understand the techniques, tools, and procedures of threat actors. When responding to a security incident, the objective is to detect and stop the attack as early as possible in the kill chain progression. The earlier the attack is stopped; the less damage is done and the less the attacker learns about the target network.

The Cyber Kill Chain specifies what an attacker must complete to accomplish their goal. The steps in the Cyber Kill Chain are shown in the figure.

If the attacker is stopped at any stage, the chain of attack is broken. Breaking the chain means the defender successfully thwarted the threat actor’s intrusion. Threat actors are successful only if they complete Step 7.

Note: Threat actor is the term used throughout this course to refer to the party instigating the attack. However, Lockheed Martin uses the term “adversary” in its description of the Cyber Kill Chain. Therefore, the terms adversary and threat actor are used interchangeably in this topic.

1. Reconnaissance: researching target information
2. Weaponization: pairing remote malware with backdoor to create a payload
3. Delivery: delivering weapon to victim through email or other means
4. Exploitation: execute code on vulnerable system by triggering the code
5. Installation: installation of backdoor on target to install malware
6. Command & Control (CnC): outside server command channel is created to manipulate target
7. Actions on Objectives: attacker uses 'hands on keyboard' access to achieve the objective of the attack

### Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is when the threat actor performs research, gathers intelligence, and selects targets. This will inform the threat actor if the attack is worth performing. Any public information may help to determine the what, where, and how of the attack to be performed. There is a lot of publicly available information, especially for larger organizations including news articles, websites, conference proceedings, and public-facing network devices. Increasing amounts of information surrounding employees is available through social media outlets.

The threat actor will choose targets that have been neglected or unprotected because they will have a higher likelihood of becoming penetrated and compromised. All information obtained by the threat actor is reviewed to determine its importance and if it reveals possible additional avenues of attack.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the reconnaissance step.

Adversary Tactics:
Plan and conduct research:
Harvest email addresses
Identify employees on social media
Collect all public relations information (press releases, awards, conference attendees, etc.)
Discover internet-facing servers
Conduct scans of the network to identify IP addresses and open ports.

SOC Defenses:
Discover adversary’s intent:
Web log alerts and historical searching data
Data mine browser analytics
Build playbooks for detecting behavior that indicate recon activity
Prioritize defense around technologies and people that reconnaissance activity is targeting

### Weaponization

The goal of this step is to use the information from reconnaissance to develop a weapon against specific targeted systems or individuals in the organization. To develop this weapon, the designer will use the vulnerabilities of the assets that were discovered and build them into a tool that can be deployed. After the tool has been used, it is expected that the threat actor has achieved their goal of gaining access into the target system or network, degrading the health of a target, or the entire network. The threat actor will further examine network and asset security to expose additional weaknesses, gain control over other assets, or deploy additional attacks.

It is not difficult to choose a weapon for the attack. The threat actor needs to look at what attacks are available for the vulnerabilities they have discovered. There are many attacks that have already been created and tested at large. One problem is that because these attacks are so well known, they are most likely also known by the defenders. It is often more effective to use a zero-day attack to avoid detection methods. A zero-day attack uses a weapon that is unknown to defenders and network security systems. The threat actor may wish to develop their own weapon that is specifically designed to avoid detection, using the information about the network and systems that they have learned. Attackers have learned how to create numerous variants of their attacks in order to evade network defenses.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the weaponization step.

Adversary Tactics:
Prepare and stage the operation:
Obtain an automated tool to deliver the malware payload (weaponizer).
Select or create a document to present to the victim.
Select or create a backdoor and command and control infrastructure.

SOC Defense:
Detect and collect weaponization artifacts:
Ensure that IDS rules and signatures are up to date.
Conduct full malware analysis.
Build detections for the behavior of known weaponizers.
Is malware old, “off the shelf” or new malware that might indicate a tailored attack?
Collect files and metadata for future analysis.
Determine which weaponizer artifacts are common to which campaigns.

### Delivery

During this step, the weapon is transmitted to the target using a delivery vector. This may be through the use of a website, removable USB media, or an email attachment. If the weapon is not delivered, the attack will be unsuccessful. The threat actor will use many different methods to increase the odds of delivering the payload such as encrypting communications, making the code look legitimate, or obfuscating the code. Security sensors are so advanced that they can detect the code as malicious unless it is altered to avoid detection. The code may be altered to seem innocent, yet still perform the necessary actions, even though it may take longer to execute.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the delivery step.

Adversary Tactics:
Launch malware at target:

Direct against web servers
Indirect delivery through:
Malicious email
Malware on USB stick
Social media interactions
Compromised websites

SOC Defense
Block delivery of malware:
Analyze the infrastructure path used for delivery.
Understand targeted servers, people, and data available to attack.
Infer intent of the adversary based on targeting.
Collect email and web logs for forensic reconstruction.

### Exploitation

After the weapon has been delivered, the threat actor uses it to break the vulnerability and gain control of the target. The most common exploit targets are applications, operating system vulnerabilities, and users. The attacker must use an exploit that gains the effect they desire. This is very important because if the wrong exploit is conducted, obviously the attack will not work, but unintended side effects such as a DoS or multiple system reboots will cause undue attention that could easily inform cybersecurity analysts of the attack and the threat actor’s intentions.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the exploitation step.

Adversary Tactics:
Exploit a vulnerability to gain access:
Use software, hardware, or human vulnerability
Acquire or develop the exploit
Use an adversary-triggered exploit for server vulnerabilities
Use a victim-triggered exploit such as opening an email attachment or malicious weblink

SOC Defense:
Train employees, secure code, and harden devices:

Employee security awareness training and periodic email testing
Web developer training for securing code
Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
Endpoint hardening measures
Endpoint auditing to forensically determine origin of exploit

### Installation

This step is where the threat actor establishes a back door into the system to allow for continued access to the target. To preserve this backdoor, it is important that remote access does not alert cybersecurity analysts or users. The access method must survive through antimalware scans and rebooting of the computer to be effective. This persistent access can also allow for automated communications, especially effective when multiple channels of communication are necessary when commanding a botnet.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the installation step.

Adversary Tactics:
Install persistent backdoor:
Install webshell on web server for persistent access.
Create point of persistence by adding services, AutoRun keys, etc.
Some adversaries modify the timestamp of the malware to make it appear as part of the operating system.

SOC Defense:
Detect, log, and analyze installation activity:
HIPS to alert or block on common installation paths.
Determine if malware requires elevated privileges or user privileges
Endpoint auditing to discover abnormal file creations.
Determine if malware is known threat or new variant.

### Command and Control

In this step, the goal is to establish command and control (CnC or C2) with the target system. Compromised hosts usually beacon out of the network to a controller on the internet. This is because most malware requires manual interaction in order to exfiltrate data from the network. CnC channels are used by the threat actor to issue commands to the software that they installed on the target. The cybersecurity analyst must be able to detect CnC communications in order to discover the compromised host. This may be in the form of unauthorized Internet Relay Chat (IRC) traffic or excessive traffic to suspect domains.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during command and control step.

Adversary Tactics:
Open channel for target manipulation:
Open two-way communications channel to CNC infrastructure
Most common CNC channels over web, DNS, and email protocols
CnC infrastructure may be adversary owned or another victim network itself

SOC Defense:
Last chance to block operation:
Research possible new CnC infrastructures
Discover CnC infrastructure though malware analysis
Isolate DNS traffic to suspect DNS servers, especially Dynamic DNS
Prevent impact by blocking or disabling CnC channel
Consolidate the number of internet points of presence
Customize rules blocking of CnC protocols on web proxies

### Actions on Objectives

The final step of the Cyber Kill Chain describes the threat actor achieving their original objective. This may be data theft, performing a DDoS attack, or using the compromised network to create and send spam or mine Bitcoin. At this point the threat actor is deeply rooted in the systems of the organization, hiding their moves and covering their tracks. It is extremely difficult to remove the threat actor from the network.

The table summarizes some of the tactics and defenses used during the actions on objectives step.

Adversary Tactics:
Reap the rewards of successful attack:

Collect user credentials
Privilege escalation
Internal reconnaissance
Lateral movement through environment
Collect and exfiltrate data
Destroy systems
Overwrite, modify, or corrupt data

SOC Defense:
Detect by using forensic evidence:

Establish incident response playbook
Detect data exfiltration, lateral movement, and unauthorized credential usage
Immediate analyst response for all alerts
Forensic analysis of endpoints for rapid triage
Network packet captures to recreate activity
Conduct damage assessment

## The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

### Diamond Model Overview

The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis is made up of four parts, as shown in the figure. The model represents a security incident or event. In the Diamond Model, an event is a time-bound activity that is restricted to a specific step in which an adversary uses a capability over infrastructure to attack a victim to achieve a specific result.

The four core features of an intrusion event are adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim:

Adversary - These are the parties responsible for the intrusion.
Capability - This is a tool or technique that the adversary uses to attack the victim.
Infrastructure - This is the network path or paths that the adversaries use to establish and maintain command and control over their capabilities.
Victim - This is the target of the attack. However, a victim might be the target initially and then used as part of the infrastructure to launch other attacks.
The adversary uses capabilities over infrastructure to attack the victim. The model can be interpreted as saying, “The adversary uses the infrastructure to connect to the victim. The adversary develops capability to exploit the victim.” For example, a capability like malware might be used over the email infrastructure by an adversary to exploit a victim.

Meta-features expand the model slightly to include the following important elements:

Timestamp - This indicates the start and stop time of an event and is an integral part of grouping malicious activity.
Phase - This is analogous to steps in the Cyber Kill Chain; malicious activity includes two or more steps executed in succession to achieve the desired result.
Result - This delineates what the adversary gained from the event. Results can be documented as one or more of the following: confidentiality compromised, integrity compromised, and availability compromised.
Direction - This indicates the direction of the event across the Diamond Model. These include Adversary-to-Infrastructure, Infrastructure-to-Victim, Victim-to-Infrastructure, and Infrastructure-to-Adversary.
Methodology - This is used to classify the general type of event, such as port scan, phishing, content delivery attack, syn flood, etc.
Resources - These are one or more external resources used by the adversary for the intrusion event, such as software, adversary’s knowledge, information (e.g., username/passwords), and assets to carry out the attack (hardware, funds, facilities, network access).

### Pivoting Across the Diamond Model

As a cybersecurity analyst, you may be called on to use the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis to diagram a series of intrusion events. The Diamond Model is ideal for illustrating how the adversary pivots from one event to the next.

For example, in the figure an employee reports that his computer is acting abnormally. A host scan by the security technician indicates that the computer is infected with malware. An analysis of the malware reveals that the malware contains a list of CnC domain names. These domain names resolve to a list of IP addresses. These IP addresses are then used to identify the adversary, as well as investigate logs to determine if other victims in the organization are using the CnC channel.

### The Diamond Model and the Cyber Kill Chain

Adversaries do not operate in just a single event. Instead, events are threaded together in a chain in which each event must be successfully completed before the next event. This thread of events can be mapped to the Cyber Kill Chain previously discussed in the chapter.

The following example, shown in the figure, illustrates the end-to-end process of an adversary as they vertically traverse the Cyber Kill Chain, use a compromised host to horizontally pivot to another victim, and then begin another activity thread:

1. Adversary conducts a web search for victim company Gadgets, Inc. receiving as part of the results the domain name gadgets.com.

2. Adversary uses the newly discovered domain gadets.com for a new search “network administrator gadget.com” and discovers forum postings from users claiming to be network administrators of gadget.com. The user profiles reveal their email addresses.

3. Adversary sends phishing emails with a Trojan horse attached to the network administrators of gadget.com.

4. One network administrator (NA1) of gadget.com opens the malicious attachment. This executes the enclosed exploit allowing for further code execution.

5. NA1’s compromised host sends an HTTP Post message to an IP address, registering it with a CnC controller. NA1’s compromised host receives an HTTP Response in return.

6. It is revealed from reverse engineering that the malware has additional IP addresses configured which act as a back-up if the first controller does not respond.

7. Through a CnC HTTP response message sent to NA1’s host, the malware begins to act as a web proxy for new TCP connections.

8. Through information from the proxy that is running on NA1’s host, Adversary does a web search for “most important research ever” and finds Victim 2, Interesting Research Inc.

9. Adversary checks NA1’s email contact list for any contacts from Interesting Research Inc. and discovers the contact for the Interesting Research Inc. Chief Research Officer.

10. Chief Research Officer of Interesting Research Inc. receives a spear-phish email from Gadget Inc.’s NA1’s email address sent from NA1’s host with the same payload as observed in Event 3.

The adversary now has two compromised victims from which additional attacks can be launched. For example, the adversary could mine the Chief Research Officer’s email contacts for the additional potential victims. The adversary might also setup another proxy to exfiltrate all of the Chief Research Officer’s files.

Note: This example is a modification of the U.S. Department of Defense’s example in the publication “The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis”.

## Incident Response

### Establishing an Incident Response Capability

Incident Response involves the methods, policies, and procedures that are used by an organization to respond to a cyberattack. The aims of incident response are to limit the impact of the attack, assess the damage caused, and implement recovery procedures. Because of the potential large-scale loss of property and revenue that can be caused by cyberattacks, it is essential that organizations create and maintain detailed incident response plans and designate personnel who are responsible for executing all aspects of that plan.

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommendations for incident response are detailed in their Special Publication 800-61, revision 2 entitled “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide”.

Note: Although this chapter summarizes much of the content in the NIST 800-61r2 standard, you should be familiar with the entire publication as it covers four major exam topics for the Understanding Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Fundamentals exam.

The NIST 800-61r2 standard provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data, and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

The first step for an organization is to establish a computer security incident response capability (CSIRC). NIST recommends creating policies, plans, and procedures for establishing and maintaining a CSIRC.

Policy Elements

An incident response policy details how incidents should be handled based on the organization’s mission, size, and function. The policy should be reviewed regularly to adjust it to meet the goals of the roadmap that has been laid out. Policy elements include the following:

Statement of management commitment
Purpose and objectives of the policy
Scope of the policy
Definition of computer security incidents and related terms
Organizational structure and definition of roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority
Prioritization of severity ratings of incidents
Performance measures
Reporting and contact forms
Plan Elements

A good incident response plan helps to minimize damage caused by an incident. It also helps to make the overall incident response program better by adjusting it according to lessons learned. It will ensure that each party involved in the incident response has a clear understanding of not only what they will be doing, but what others will be doing as well. Plan elements are as follows:

Mission
Strategies and goals
Senior management approval
Organizational approach to incident response
How the incident response team will communicate with the rest of the organization and with other organizations
Metrics for measuring the incident response capacity
How the program fits into overall organization
Procedure Elements

The procedures that are followed during an incident response should follow the incident response plan. Procedures elements are as follows:

Technical processes
Using techniques
Filling out forms,
Following checklists
These are typical standard operating procedures (SOPs). These SOPs should be detailed so that the mission and goals of the organization are in mind when these procedures are followed. SOPs minimize errors that may be caused by personnel that are under stress while participating in incident handling. It is important to share and practice these procedures, making sure that they are useful, accurate, and appropriate.
