### Ethical Hacking Statement

Training to become a cybersecurity specialist requires in depth **understanding and exposure to how cyber attacks occur**, **as well as how they are detected and prevented**. Security holes and vulnerabilities that are created in this course **should only be used in an ethical manner and only in this "sandboxed" virtual environment**.


### Hijacked People

**Rogue** wireless hotspots, as well known "evil twin" is a technique that a hacker set up an open "rogue" wireless hotspot posing as another, like a coffee shop's wireless network. When someone logged onto her bank's website, for instance, the hacker hijacked her session and gained access to her bank accounts.

### Ransomed Companies

**Curiosity** is a flaw that drive someone to open an email and click in an unknown attachment.The same scenario plays out across the organization as dozens of other employees are successfully enticed to click the attachment. When the PDF opens, ransomware is installed on the employees’ computers and begins the process of gathering and encrypting corporate data. The goal of the attackers is financial gain, because they hold the company’s data for ransom until they are paid.

### Targeted Nations

Such malware can be targeted to attack a nation’s vulnerable infrastructure, such as the water system or power grid. This was the purpose of **the Stuxnet worm**, which infected USB drives. These drives were carried by five Iranian component vendors into a secure facility that they supported. Stuxnet was designed to infiltrate Windows OS and then target Step 7 software. 
**Step 7 was developed by Siemens** for their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Stuxnet was looking for a specific model of the Siemens PLCs that controls the centrifuges in uranium processing facilities. **The worm was transmitted from the infected USB drives into the PLCs and eventually damaged many of these centrifuges**.

**Zero Days**, a film released in 2016, documents what is known about the development and deployment of the Stuxnet targeted malware attack. Search for Zero Days to find the film or information about the film.


## Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups of individuals who perform cyberattacks. Cyberattacks are intentional malicious acts meant to negatively impact another individual or organization.

At least there are five threat actors

* amateurs: also known as **script kiddies**, have little or no skill. Generally they use tools or instructions found on the internet to launch attacks.
* hacktivists: they are hackers who protest against a variety of political and social ideas. Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by posting articles and videos, leaking sensitive information, and disrupting web services with illegitimate traffic in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
  
* organized crime groups
* state-sponsored
* terrorist groups

Much of the hacking activity that consistently threatens our security is motivated by financial gain. **These cybercriminals** want to gain access to our bank accounts, personal data, and anything else they can leverage to generate cash flow.

**Trade secrets and global politics**: In the past several years, we have heard many stories about nation states hacking other countries, or otherwise interfering with internal politics. Nation states are also interested in using cyberspace for industrial espionage. The theft of intellectual property can give a country a significant advantage in international trade. Defending against the fallout from state-sponsored cyberespionage and cyberwarfare will continue to be a priority for cybersecurity professionals.

## How secure in the internet of things (IoT)?

* How secure are these devices? 
* For example, who wrote the firmware? 
* Did the programmer pay attention to security flaws? 
* Is your connected home thermostat vulnerable to attacks? 
* What about your digital video recorder (DVR)? 
* If security vulnerabilities are found, can firmware in the device be patched to eliminate the vulnerability?

In October 2016, **a DDoS attack** against the domain name provider Dyn took down many popular websites. The attack came **from a large number of webcams, DVRs, routers, and other IoT devices** that had been compromised by malicious software. **These devices formed a “botnet”** that was controlled by hackers. This **botnet** was used to create an enormous DDoS attack that disabled essential internet services. Dyn has posted a blog to explain the attack and their reaction to it. Search on “Dyn Analysis Summary of Friday October 21 Attack” to learn more about this record-breaking attack.

For an explanation of the dangers of not securing IoT devices, search for Avi Rubin’s TED talk, “All Your Devices can be Hacked.” Dr. Rubin is a Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.

## Threat Impact

### 1.3.1 PII, PHI, and PSI

Some lingo:

1. **PII or Personally Identifiable Information**: it is any information that can be used to positively identify an individual: name, social security number, birthday, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, government issu**Ransomware**e ID, address information (street, email, phone numbers).One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be sold on the dark web.
1. **PHI or Protected health information**: it is a subnet of PII. The medical community creates and maintains **electronic medical records (EMRs)** **that contain PHI**. In the U.S., handling of PHI is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (**HIPAA**). In the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**) protects a broad range of personal information in including health records.
1. **PSI or Personal Security Information**: it i**Ransomware**another type of PII. This information includes usernames, passwords, and other security-related information that individuals use to access information or services on the network.

## The Danger Summary

### What did I learn in this module?

1. War Stories: There is a three-level threat actors: personal information, that can hijack by using "evil twin"; company level, as in the example where opening a pdf on the company computer can install ransomware; nation level, such as Stuxnet.
1. Threat actors: amateurs, hacktivists, organized crime groups, state sponsored, and terrorist groups.
1. Threat impact: PII, PHI, PSI

### 1.4.2 The Danger Quiz

1. An attacker sends a piece of malware as an email attachment to employees in a company. What is one probable purpose of the attack? 
   **The purpose of the attack is searching and obtaining trade secrets**. 
   Let's take a closer look: This is a topic 1.1.0, module 2.1. **This is a malware attack**, which has the purpose of disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive information, or gain access to a private computer system. **Cracking a password cannot be carried out** by a simple malware attack because it requires intensive CPU and memory, which will **make its operation noticeable.** A reconnais**Ransomware**
2. What is cyberwarfare? 
   It is an attack designed **to disrupt, corrupt, or exploit national interests**. 
   Taking a closer look: cyberwarfare is a subset of **information warfare (IW)**. **Its objective is to disrupt (availability), corrupt (integrity) or exploit (confidentiality or privacy).** It can be directed against military forces, critical infrastructures, or other national interests, such as economic targets. It involves several teams that work together. Botnet might be one of several tools to be used for launching the attack.
   
3. What type of malware has the primary objective of spreading across the network? 
   It's a topic 1.1.0. **Worm**. The main purpose of **a worm is to self-replicate and propagate across the network**. 
   **A virus is a type of malicious software that needs a user to spread**. 
   **A trojan horse is not self-replicating and disguises itself** as a legitimate application **when it is not**. 
   **A botnet is a series of zombie computers** working together **to wage a network attack**.
   
4. What is a potential risk when using a free and open wireless hotspot in a public location?
   The potential risk when using a free and open wireless hotspot in a public location **is that the network traffic might be hijacked and information might be stolen**. Topic 1.1.0 - Many free and open wireless hotspots operate with no authentication or weak authentication mechanisms. Attackers could easily **Ransomware**capture the network traffic in and out of such a hotspot and steal user information. In addition, attackers might set up a **"rogue" wireless hotspot** to attract unsuspecting users to it and then collect information from those users.
   
5. At the request of investors, a company is proceeding with cyber attribution with a particular attack that was conducted from an external source. Which security term is used to describe the person or device responsible for the attack? 
   **The responsible for the attack is known **as threat actor****. Topic 1.2.0. Some people may use the common word of "hacker" to describe a threat actor. A threat actor is an entity that is involved with an incident that impacts or has the potential to impact an organization in such a way that it is considered a security risk or threat.
   
6. What name is given to an amateur hacker? 
   Topic 1.2.0. He's known as **script kiddie**.
   
7. What commonly motivates cybercriminals to attack networks as compared to hacktivists or state-sponsored hackers? 
   Topic 1.1.1. Usually, cybercriminals are motivated by **financial gain**. Cybercriminals are commonly motivated by money. Hackers are known to hack for status. Cyberterrorists are motivated to commit cybercrimes for religious or political reasons.  
   
8. What is a botnet? 
   Topic 1.2.0. **Bot is a network of infected computers that are controlled as a group**. One method of executing a DDoS attack involves using a botnet. A botnet builds or purchases a botnet of zombie hosts, **which is a group of infected devices**. **The zombies continue to create more zombies which carry out the DDoS attack**.
   
9.  What is a rogue wireless hotspot? 
    Topic 1.1.0. **It is a hotspot that appears to be from a legitimate business but was actually set up by someone without permission from the business**. A rogue wireless hotspot is a wireless access point running in a business or an organization without the official permission from the business or organization.
    
10. What is the best definition of personally identifiable information (PII)? 
    Topic 1.3.0. **Data that is collected by businesses to distinguish identities of individuals.** Personally identifiable information (PII) is data that could be used to distinguish the identity of an individual, such as mother's maiden name, social security number, and/or date of birth.
    
11. What was used as a cyberwarfare weapon to attack a uranium enrichment facility in Iran?
    Topic 1.1.0. **Stuxnet.** The Stuxnet malware program is an excellent example of a sophisticated cyberwarfare weapon. In 2010, it was used to attack programmable logic controllers that operated uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran.
    
12. A company pays a significant sum of money to hackers in order to regain control of an email and data server. Which type of security attack was used by the hackers? 
    Topic 1.1.0. **Ransomware**. Ransomware involves the hackers preventing user access to the infected and controlled system until the user pays a specified amount.
