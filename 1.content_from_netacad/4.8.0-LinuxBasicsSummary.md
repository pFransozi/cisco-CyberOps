## Linux Basics Summary What did I learn in this module?

* **Linux Basics**: **Linux is a fast, reliable, and small open-source operating system**. It requires **few hardware resources to run and is highly customizable**. It is **designed to be used on networks**. The Linux kernel is distributed by different organizations with different tools and software packages. A customized version of Linux that is called Security Onion contains software and tools that are designed for use in network security monitoring by cybersecurity analysts. **Kali Linux is another customized Linux distribution that has numerous tools that are designed for network security penetration testing**.

* **Working in the Linux Shell**: In Linux, the **user communicates with the operating system through a GUI or a command-line interface (CLI), or shell**. Linux commands are programs that perform a specific task. The man command, followed by a specific command, provides documentation for that command. It is important to know at least basic Linux commands, file and directory commands, and commands for working with text files. In Linux everything is treated is if it were a file, including the memory, disks, monitor, and directories.

* **Linux Servers and Clients**: **Servers are computers that have software installed that enables them to provide services to client computers across the network**. **Some services provide access to external resources such as files, email, and web pages, to clients upon request**. Other services run internally and perform tasks such as log management, memory management, or disk scanning. To enable a computer to provide multiple services, ports are used. **A port is a reserved network resource that “listens” for requests by clients**. **While the port number that is used by a service can be configured, most services listen on default “well-known” ports**. Client software applications are designed to communicate with specific types of servers. Web browsers are designed to communicate with web servers by using the HTTP protocol on port 80. FTP clients communicate with FTP servers to transfer files.

* **Basic Server Administration**: In Linux, **servers are managed by using configuration files**. Various settings can be modified and saved in configuration files. **When a service is started, it looks at its configuration file(s) to know how it should run**. There is no rule for the way configuration files are written. Configuration file formatting depends on the creator of the server software. Linux devices should be secured by using proven methods to protect the device and administrative access. **This is known as hardening devices**. **One way to harden a device is to maintain passwords, configure enhanced login features, and implement secure remote login with SSH**. **It is also very important to keep the operating system up to date**. **Other ways to harden a device are to force periodic password changes, enforce strong passwords, and to prevent reuse of passwords**. Finally, Linux clients and servers **use logfiles to record the operation of the system and important events**. A number of different logfiles are maintained including application logs, event logs, service logs, and system logs. Server logs record activities that are conducted by remote users who access system services. It is important to know the location of different logs in the Linux file system so that they can be accessed and monitored for problems.

* **The Linux File System**: **Linux supports a number of different file systems that vary by speed, flexibility, security, size, structure, logic, and more**. Some of the file systems that are supported by Linux are ext2, ext3, ext4, NFS, and CDFS. File systems are mounted on partitions and accessed through mounting points, or directories. Windows drive letters are examples of mounting points. The mount command can be used to display details of the file systems that are currently mounted on a Linux computer. **The root file system is represented by the “/” symbol**. It contains all of the files in the computer by default. **Linux uses file permissions to control who is permitted to have different types of access to files and directories**. **Permissions include read (r), write (w), and execute (x)**. **Files and directories have permissions that are assigned for users, groups, and others**. **The permissions for files and folders are displayed with the ls -l command**. This command also displays the links for a file. **Hard links create another file with a different name that is linked to the same place in the file system**. **The owner of the file and the group for the file are also displayed along with the date and time of the last modification to the file**. **File permissions are powerful features of the Linux file system and can’t be violated**. **Only the root user can override file permissions. Because of the power of the root user, root access should be carefully controlled**. Hard links are created with the ln command. Changes to one of the hard-linked files are also made to the original file. Symbolic links, or symlinks, are similar to hard links in that a change to the linked file is reflected in the original file. Symbolic links have several advantages over hard links.

* **Working with Linux GUI**: The X Windows, or X11, system is a basic software framework that includes functions for creating, controlling, and configuring a windows GUI in a point-and-click interface. Different vendors use the X Windows system to create different windows manager GUIs for Linux. Examples of windows managers are Gnome and KDE. The Ubuntu Linux distribution uses Gnome 3 by default. The Gnome 3 desktop consists of the Apps Menu, Ubuntu Dock, Top Bar, Calendar and System Message tray, the Activities area, and the Status Menu.

* **Working on a Linux Host**: In order to install applications on Linux hosts, programs called package managers are used. Packages are software applications and all of their supporting files. Package managers are extremely helpful for installing complex software applications from centralized package repositories that are accessible over the internet. Different Linux distributions use different package managers. For example, Arch Linux uses pacman, Debian uses dpkg as the base package manager and apt to communicate with dpkg. Ubuntu also uses apt. Package manager CLI commands are used to install, remove, and update software packages. Upgrade commands upgrade all currently installed packages. Package management can also be performed in a GUI. Software processes are instances of computer programs that are running. Multitasking operating systems can run many processes at the same time. Forking is a method that the kernel uses to allow a running process to copy itself. The ps command lists the running processes, top displays information about running processes dynamically, and kill is used to remove, restart, or pause running processes. While Linux is considered to be better protected against malicious software (malware) than other operating systems, it is still susceptible to Trojan horses, worms, and other types of malware. Linux is usually attacked through its services and processes. Out of date software is often vulnerable to attack. Threat actors can probe a device for open ports that are linked to out of date server processes. With this knowledge, attacks can be launched. It is important to keep the operating system and its components and applications up to date. The chkrootkit program is designed to detect rootkit malware. Rootkits are deep level malware programs that are very difficult to detect and remove. They can change the fundamental operation of the operating system itself and can be used to create unauthorized access to systems. Piping commands uses the “|” symbol to chain different commands together by using the output of one command as the input for another.

### 4.8.2 Linux Basics Quiz

1. Which type of tool is used by a Linux administrator to attack a computer or network to find vulnerabilities? 
   Topic 4.1.0 - **PenTesting** is known as penetration testing and includes tools that are used to search for vulnerabilities in a network or computer by attacking it.

2. What is a benefit of Linux being an open source operating system? 
   Topic 4.1.0 - **Linux is an open source operating system and any person can access the source code**, inspect it, modify it, and recompile it. Linux distributions are maintained by a community of programmers and are designed to be connected to a network and do not have to provide free support.

3. Which method can be used to harden a device? 
   Topic 4.4.0 - The basic best practices for device hardening are as follows: **Ensure physical security. Minimize installed packages. Disable unused services. Use SSH and disable the root account login over SSH. Keep the system updated. Disable USB auto-detection. Enforce strong passwords. Force periodic password changes. Keep  users from re-using old passwords. Review logs regularly**. 

4. A system administrator issues the command ps on a server that is running the Linux operating system. What is the purpose of this command? 
   Topic 4.2.0 - **The Linux ps command is used to list the currently running processes in the system**. If needed, this command can be instructed to display running processes initiated by the current user or other users.

5. Which operating system source code can be downloaded and modified by any person or company?
   Topic 4.1.0 - **Open-source programs**, like Linux, allow the source code to be distributed and changed by anyone.

6. Which file system is the primary file system used by Apple in current Macintosh computers?
   Topic 4.5.0 - The primary file system used **by Apple in its lates Macintosh computers is APFS**.

7. Consider the result of the ls -l command in the Linux output below. What are the group file permissions assigned to the analyst.txt file? 
   ls –l analyst.txt -rwxrw-r-- sales staff 1028 May 28 15:50 analyst.txt. Topic 4.5.0 - The file permissions are always displayed in the User, Group and Other order. In the example displayed, the file has the following permissions: The dash (-) means that this is a file. For directories, the first dash would be replaced with a \"d\". The first set of characters is for user permission (rwx). The user, sales, who owns the file can read, write and execute the file. The second set of characters is for group permissions (rw-). The group, staff, who owns the file can read and write to the file. The third set of characters is for any other user or group permissions (r--). Any other user or group on the computer can only read the file. 

8. In the context of a Linux operating system, which command can be used to display the syntax and parameters for a specific command? 
   Topic 4.2.0 - The functions of listed CLI commands of a Linux system are as follows: cat – lists the contents of a file. man – displays the documentation for a specific command. crontab – manages the cron service for scheduling system tasks. grep – searches for specific strings of characters within a file or other commands outputs.

9. What is a daemon?
    Topic 4.4.0 - **A daemon in Linux is a background process that runs without the need for user interaction**. A network administrator can view log files in order to see information about daemons running on the Linux server.

10. Which Linux command can be used to display the name of the current working directory?
    Topic 4.2.0 - **One of the most important commands in Linux is the pwd command**, which stands for print working directory. It shows users the physical path for the directory they are working in.

11. An author is uploading one chapter document from a personal computer to a file server of a book publisher. What role is the personal computer assuming in this network model?
    Topic 4.3.0 - **In the client/server network model, a network device assumes the role of server in order to provide a particular service such as file transfer and storage**. The device requesting the service assumes the role of client. In the client/server network model, a dedicated server does not have to be used, but if one is present, the network model being used is the client/server model. In contrast, the peer-to-peer network model does not have a dedicated server.

12. A technician has captured packets on a network that has been running slowly when accessing the internet. Which port number should the technician look for within the captured material to locate HTTP packets?
    Topic 4.3.0 - **HTTP uses TCP port 80 and HTTPS uses TCP port 443**. HTTP and HTTPS are protocols commonly used to access web pages.

13. A system administrator issues the apt-get upgrade command on a Linux operating system. What is the purpose of this command?
    Topic 4.7.0 - **When the apt-get upgrade command is issued in a Linux terminal, all installed applications will attempt to upgrade to the latest version available**.

14. Why would a rootkit be used by a hacker?
