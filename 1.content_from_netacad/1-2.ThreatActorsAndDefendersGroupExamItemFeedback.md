**4 What type of cyberwarfare weapon was Stuxnet?**
Wrong answer: botnet
**Right answer: worm**

The Stuxnet worm was an excellent example of a sophisticated cyberwarfare weapon. In 2010, it was used to attack programmable logic controllers that operated uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran. Topic: 1.1.3 Threat Impact

**12 What are two examples of personally identifiable information (PII)? (Choose two.)**
Wrong answer: first name, credit card number
Right answer: street address, credit card number

Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that could potentially identify and track a specific individual. A credit card number and street address are the best examples of PII. Topic: 1.1.3 Threat Impact

**18 Which personnel in a SOC are assigned the task of hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools?**
Wrong answer: T1 Analyst
Right answer: T3 SME

In a SOC, Tier 3 SMEs have expert-level skills in network, endpoint, threat intelligence, and malware reverse engineering (RE). They are deeply involved in hunting for potential security threats and implementing threat detection tools. Topic: 1.2.1 The Modern Security Operations Center.

21 Which three technologies should be included in a SOC security information and event management system? (Choose three.)
Wrong answer: intrusion prevention, security management, log management
Right answer: security monitoring, log management, threat intelligence

Technologies in a SOC should include the following:

* Event collection, correlation, and analysis
* Security monitoring
* Security control
* Log management
* Vulnerability assessment
* Vulnerability tracking
* Threat intelligence

Proxy server, VPN, and IPS are security devices deployed in the network infrastructure. Topic: 1.2.1 The modern security operations center

25 Question as presented: Match the SOC metric to the description. (Not all options are used.)

MTTC
MTTR
MTTD 
Dwell time

time required to stop the spread of malware in the network
time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
length of time that threat actors have access to a network before their access is stopped
average time to identify that valid security incidents have occurred in the network 
average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident

Dwell time -> length of time that threat actors have access to a network before their access is stopped;
MTTR -> average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident
MTTC -> time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
MTTD -> average time to identify that valid security incidents have occurred in the network

3. A user calls the help desk complaining that the password to access the wireless network has changed without warning. The user is allowed to change the password, but an hour later, the same thing occurs. What might be happening in this situation? 

**ROGUE ACCESS POINT**

Man-in-the-middle attacks are a threat that results in lost credentials and data. These type of 
attacks can occur for different reasons including traffic sniffing. 

23. What job would require verification that an alert represents a true security incident or a false positive? 

Alert Analyst

 A Cybersecurity Analyst monitors security alert queues and uses a ticketing system to assign alerts to a queue for an analyst to investigate. Because the software that generates alerts can trigger false alarms, one job of the Cybersecurity Analyst would be to verify that an alert represents a true security incident.

24.  Which KPI metric does SOAR use to measure the time required to stop the spread of malware in the network? 

Time of Control

The common key performance indicator (KPI) metrics compiled by SOC managers are as follows:
• Dwell Time: the length of time that threat actors have access to a network before they are detected and the access of the threat actors stopped
• Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): the average time that it takes for the SOC personnel to identify that valid security incidents have occurred in the network
• Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): the average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident
• Mean Time to Contain (MTTC): the time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
• Time to Control: the time required to stop the spread of malware in the network
