# Endpoint Vulnerability Assessment

## Network and Server Profiling

### Network Profiling

Networks, servers, and hosts all exhibit typical behavior for a given point in time. **Network and device profiling can provide a statistical baseline that serves as a reference point**. Unexplained deviations from the baseline may indicate a compromise.

Care must be taken when capturing baseline data so that all normal network operations are included in the baseline. In addition, **it is important that the baseline is current**. It should not include network performance data that is no longer part of normal functioning. For example, rises in network utilization during periodic server backup operations is part of normal network functioning and should be part of the baseline data. However, measurement of traffic that corresponds to outside access to an internal server that has been moved to the cloud would not be. A means of capturing just the right period for baseline measurement is known as sliding window anomaly detection. It defines a window that is most representative of network operation and deletes data that is out of date. This process continues with repeated baseline measurements to ensure that baseline measurement statistics depict network operation with maximum accuracy.

Increased utilization of WAN links at unusual times can indicate a network breach and exfiltration of data. **Hosts that begin to access obscure internet servers, resolve domains that are obtained through dynamic DNS, or use protocols or services that are not needed by the system user can also indicate compromise**. Deviations in network behavior are difficult to detect if normal behavior is not known.

Tools like NetFlow and Wireshark can be used to characterize normal network traffic characteristics. Because organizations can make different demands on their networks depending on the time of day or day of the year, network baselining should be carried out over an extended period. The figure displays some questions to ask when establishing a network baseline.

The table lists important elements of the network profile.

|Network Profile Element| Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
|Session duration       |This is the time between the establishment of a data flow and its termination|
|Total throughput       |This is the amount of data passing from a given source to a given destination in a given period of time|
|Ports used             |This is a list of TCP or UDP processes that are available to accept data|
|Critical asset address space|These are the IP addresses or the logical location of essential systems or data|

In addition, **a profile of the types of traffic that typically enter and leave the network is an important tool in understanding network behavior**. **Malware can use unusual ports that may not be typically seen during normal network operation**. Host-to-host traffic is another important metric. Most network clients communicate directly with servers, so an increase of traffic between clients can indicate that malware is spreading laterally through the network.

Finally, changes in user behavior, as revealed by AAA, server logs, or a user profiling system like Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is another valuable indicator. Knowing how individual users typically use the network leads to detection of potential compromise of user accounts. A user who suddenly begins logging in to the network at strange times from a remote location should raise alarms if this behavior is a deviation from a known norm.

### Server Profiling

Server profiling is used to establish **the accepted operating state of servers**. A server profile **is a security baseline for a given server. It establishes the network, user, and application parameters that are accepted for a specific server.**

In order to establish a server profile, it is important to understand the function that a server is intended to perform in a network. From there, various operating and usage parameters can be defined and documented.

The table lists elements of a server profile.

|Server Profile Element|Description|
|----------------------|-----------|
|Listening ports       |These are the TCP and UDP daemons and ports that are normally allowed to be open on the server|
|Logged in users and accounts|These are the parameters defining user access and behavior|
|Service accounts|These are the definitions of the type of service that an application is allowed to run|
|Software environment|These are the tasks, processes, and applications that are permitted to run on the server|

### Network Anomaly Detection

Network behavior is described by a large amount of diverse data such as the features of packet flow, features of the packets themselves, and telemetry from multiple sources. One approach to detection of network attacks is the analysis of this diverse, unstructured data using Big Data analytics techniques. This is known as network behavior analysis (NBA).

This entails the use of sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques to compare normal performance baselines with network performance at a given time. Significant deviations can be indicators of compromise. In addition, network behavior can be analyzed for known network behaviors that indicate compromise.

Anomaly detection can recognize network traffic caused by worm activity that exhibits scanning behavior. Anomaly detection also can identify infected hosts on the network that are scanning for other vulnerable hosts.

### Network Vulnerability Testing

Most organizations connect to public networks in some way due to the need to access the internet. These organizations must also provide internet facing services of various types to the public. Because of the vast number of potential vulnerabilities, and the fact that new vulnerabilities can be created within an organization network and its internet facing services, **periodic security testing is essential**.

The table lists various types of tests that can be performed.

|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Risk Analysis| This is a discipline in which analysts evaluate the risk posed by vulnerabilities to a specific organization; a risk analysis includes assessment of the likelihood of attacks, identifies types of likely threat actors, and evaluates the impact of successful exploits on the organization|
|Vulnerability Assessment|This test employs software to scan internet facing servers and internal networks for various types of vulnerabilities; These vulnerabilities include unknown infections, weaknesses in web-facing database services, missing software patches, unnecessary listening ports, etc; Tools for vulnerability assessment include the open source OpenVAS platform, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, Nessus, Qualys, and FireEye Mandiant services; Vulnerability assessment includes, but goes beyond, port scanning|
|Penetration Testing| This type of test uses authorized simulated attacks to test the strength of network security; Internal personnel with hacker experience, or professional ethical hackers, identify assets that could be targeted by threat actors; A series of exploits is used to test security of those assets; Simulated exploit software tools are frequently used; Penetration testing does not only verify that vulnerabilities exist, it actually exploits those vulnerabilities to determine the potential impact of a successful exploit; An individual penetration test is often known as a pen test; Metasploit is a tool used in penetration testing; CORE Impact offers penetration testing software and services|

The table lists examples of activities and tools that are used in vulnerability testing.

|Activity|Description|Tools|
|--------|-----------|-----|
|Risk analysis|Individuals conduct comprehensive analysis of impacts of attacks on core company assets and functioning|Internal or external consultants, risk management frameworks|
|Vulnerability Assessment|Patch management, host scans, port scanning, other vulnerability scans and services|OpenVas, Microsoft Baseline Analyzer, Nessus, Qualys, Nmap|

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

### CVSS Overview

**The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a risk assessment tool that is designed to convey the common attributes and severity of vulnerabilities in computer hardware and software systems**. The third revision, CVSS 3.0, is a vendor-neutral, industry standard, open framework **for weighting the risks of a vulnerability using a variety of metrics**. **These weights combine to provide a score of the risk inherent in a vulnerability**. The numeric score can be used to determine the urgency of the vulnerability, and the priority of addressing it. The benefits of the CVSS can be summarized as follows:

* It provides standardized vulnerability scores that should be meaningful across organizations.
* It provides an open framework with the meaning of each metric openly available to all users.
* It helps prioritize risk in a way that is meaningful to individual organizations.

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) has been designated as the custodian of the CVSS to promote its adoption globally. The Version 3 standard was developed with contributions by Cisco and other industry partners. Version 3.1 was released in June of 2019. The figure displays the specification page for the CVSS at the FIRST website.

### CVSS Metric Groups

Before performing a CVSS assessment, it is important to know key terms that are used in the assessment instrument.

Many of the metrics address the role of what the CVSS calls an authority. An authority is a computer entity, such as a database, operating system, or virtual sandbox, that grants and manages access and privileges to users.

1. Base metric group: it represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across contexts. It has two classes of metrics.
    * exploitability: these are features of the exploit such as the vector, complexity, and user interaction required by the exploit, such as: 
        * **attack vector**: This is a metric that reflects the proximity of the threat actor to the vulnerable component. The more remote the threat actor is to the component, the higher the severity. Threat actors close to your network or inside your network are easier to detect and mitigate.

        * **attack complexity**: This is a metric that expresses the number of components, software, hardware, or networks, that are beyond the attacker’s control and that must be present for a vulnerability to be successfully exploited.

        * **privileges required**: This is a metric that captures the level of access that is required for a successful exploit of the vulnerability.

        * **user interaction**: This metric expresses the presence or absence of the requirement for user interaction for an exploit to be successful.

        * **scope**: This metric expresses whether multiple authorities must be involved in an exploit. This is expressed as whether the initial authority changes to a second authority during the exploit.

    * impact metrics: the impacts of the exploit are rooted in the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, such as: confidentiality, integrity impact, availability impact.
    * between two above, there is a scope.

2. temporal metric group: this measures the characteristics of a vulnerability that may change over time, but not across user environments. Over time, the severity of a vulnerability will change as it is detected and measures to counter it are developed. The severity of a new vulnerability may be high, but will decrease as patches, signatures, and other countermeasures are developed, such as exploit code maturity, remediation level, report confidence.

3. environmental metric group: this measures the aspects of a vulnerability that are rooted in a specific organization's environment. These metrics help to rate consequences within an organization and allow adjustment of metrics that are less relevant to what an organization does, such as: modified base metrics, 
    **confidentiality requirement**: This is a metric that measures **the impact to confidentiality due to a successfully exploited vulnerability**. Confidentiality refers to the limiting of access to only authorized users. 
    **integrity requirement**: This is a metric that measures the impact to integrity due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and authenticity of information.
    **availability requirement**: This is a metric that measures the impact to availability due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Availability refers to the accessibility of information and network resources. Attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability.

### The CVSS Process

The CVSS Base Metrics Group is designed as a way to assess security vulnerabilities that are found in software and hardware systems. It describes the severity of a vulnerability based on the characteristics of a successful exploit of the vulnerability. The other metric groups modify the base severity score by accounting for how the base severity rating is affected by time and environmental factors.

The calculator is like a questionnaire in which choices are made that describe the vulnerability for each metric group. After all choices are made, a score is generated. Pop-up text that explains each metric and metric value is displayed by hovering the mouse over each. Choices are made by choosing one of the values for the metric. Only one choice can be made per metric.

The CVSS calculator can be accessed on the CVSS portion of the FIRST website.

A detailed user guide that defines metric criteria, examples of assessments of common vulnerabilities, and the relationship of metric values to the final score is available to support the process.

A vector string is also created that summarizes the choices made. If other metric groups are completed, those values are appended to the vector string. The string consists of the initial(s) for the metric, and an abbreviated value for the selected metric value separated by a colon. The metric-value pairs are separated by slashes. The vector strings allow the results of the assessment to be easily shared and compared.

The table lists the key for the Base Metric group.

|Metric Name|Initials|Possible Values|Values|
|-----------|--------|---------------|------|
|Attack Vector|AV|[N, A, L, P]|N = Network; A = Adjacent; L = Local;P = Physical|
|Attack Complexity|AC|[L, H]|L = Low;H = High|
|Privileges Required|PR|[N, L, H]|N = None;L = Low;H = High|
|User Interaction|UI|[N, R]|N = None; R = Required|
|Scope|S|[U, C]|U = Unchanged; C = Changed|
|Confidentiality Impact|C|[H, L, N]|H = High; L = Low; N = None|
|Integrity Impact|I|[H, L, N]|H = High; L = Low; N = None;|
|Availability Impact|A|[H, L, N]|H = High; L = Low; N = None|
|

The values for the numeric severity rating string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N are listed in the table.

|Metric Name|Values|
|-----------|------|
|Attack Vector, AV|Network|
|Attack Complexity, AC|Low|
|Privileges Required, PR|High|
|User Interaction, UI|None|
|Scope, S|Unchanged|
|Confidentiality Impact, C|Low|
|Integrity Impact, I|Low|
|Availability Impact, A| None|

In order for a score to be calculated for the Temporal or Environmental metric groups, the Base Metric group must first be completed. The Temporal and Environmental metric values then modify the Base Metric results to provide an overall score. The interaction of the scores for the metric groups is shown in the figure.

### CVSS Reports

The ranges of scores and the corresponding qualitative meaning is shown in the table.

|Rating|CVSS Score|
|None|0|
|Low|0.1 – 3.9|
|Medium|4.0 – 6.9|
|High|7.0 – 8.9|
|Critical|9.0 – 10.0|

Frequently, the Base and Temporal metric group scores will be supplied to customers by the application or security vendor in whose product the vulnerability has been discovered. The affected organization completes the environmental metric group to tailor the vendor-supplied scoring to the local context.

The resulting score serves to guide the affected organization in the allocation of resources to address the vulnerability. The higher the severity rating, the greater the potential impact of an exploit and the greater the urgency in addressing the vulnerability. While not as precise as the numeric CVSS scores, the qualitative labels are very useful for communicating with stakeholders who are unable to relate to the numeric scores.

In general, any vulnerability that exceeds 3.9 should be addressed. The higher the rating level, the greater the urgency for remediation.

### Other Vulnerability Information Sources

There are other important vulnerability information sources. These work together with the CVSS to provide a comprehensive assessment of vulnerability severity. There are two systems that operate in the United States:

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**

This is a dictionary of common names, in the form of CVE identifiers, for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The CVE identifier provides a standard way to research a reference to vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability has been identified, CVE identifiers can be used to access fixes. In addition, threat intelligence services use CVE identifiers, and they appear in various security system logs. The CVE Details website provides a linkage between CVSS scores and CVE information. It allows browsing of CVE vulnerability records by CVSS severity rating.

**National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**, This utilizes CVE identifiers and supplies additional information on vulnerabilities such as CVSS threat scores, technical details, affected entities, and resources for further investigation. The database was created and is maintained by the U.S. government National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) agency.

### Check Your Understanding - Identify CVSS Metrics

5. Which CVSS metric expresses whether human action is required for the exploit to succeed? **User interaction** expresses whether human action is required for the exploit to succeed.

## Secure Device Management

### Risk Management

**Risk management** is an ongoing, multi-step, cyclical process:

1. Identity assets, vulnerabilities, threats, which means **risk identification**;
2. score, weight, prioritize risks, which means **risk assessment**;
3. determine risk response plan actions, which means **risk response planning**;
4. implement risk response, which means **response implementation**;
5. continuous risk monitoring and response evaluation, which means monitor and assess results

Risk is determined as the **relationship between threat, vulnerability, and the nature of the organization**. It first involves answering the following questions as part of a risk assessment:

1. Who are the threat actors who want to attack us?
2. What vulnerabilities can threat actors exploit?
3. How would we be affected by attacks?
4. What is the likelihood that different attacks will occur?

NIST Special Publication 800-30 describes **risk assessment as**:

…the process of **identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security risks**. Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur.

A mandatory activity in risk assessment **is the identification of threats and vulnerabilities and the matching of threats with vulnerabilities in what is often called threat-vulnerability (T-V) pairing**. The T-V pairs can then be used as a baseline to indicate risk before security controls are implemented. This baseline can then be compared to ongoing risk assessments as a means of evaluating risk management effectiveness. This part of risk assessment is referred to as determining the inherent risk profile of an organization.

**After the risks are identified, they may be scored or weighted as a way of prioritizing risk reduction strategies**. For example, vulnerabilities that are found to have corresponded with multiple threats can receive higher ratings. In addition, T-V pairs that map to the greatest institutional impact will also receive higher weightings.

The table lists the four potential ways to respond to risks that have been identified, based on their weightings or scores.

|Risk|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Risk avoidance|Stop performing the activities that create risk. It is possible that as a result of a risk assessment, it is determined that the risk involved in an activity outweighs the benefit of the activity to the organization. If this is found to be true, then it may be determined that the activity should be discontinued|
|Risk reduction|Decrease the risk by taking measures to reduce vulnerability. This involves implementing management approaches discussed earlier in this chapter. For example, if an organization uses server operating systems that are frequently targeted by threat actors, risk can be reduced through ensuring that the servers are patched as soon as vulnerabilities have been identified|
|Risk sharing|Shift some of the risk to other parties. For example, a risk-sharing technique might be to outsource some aspects of security operations to third parties. Hiring a security as a service (SECaaS) CSIRT to perform security monitoring is an example. Another example is to buy insurance that will help to mitigate some of the financial losses due to a security incident|
|Risk retention|Accept the risk and its consequences. This strategy is acceptable for risks that have low potential impact and relatively high cost of mitigation or reduction. Other risks that may be retained are those that are so dramatic that they cannot realistically be avoided, reduced, or shared.


### Check Your Understanding - Identify the Risk Response

1. Which risk response accepts the risk and its consequences? **Risk retention** means that the risk and its consequences are accepted without action.

2. Which risk response outsources some of the risk to other parties, such as Security as a Service? In the **risk sharing** risk response, some of the risk is outsourced to a Security as a Service or insurance company.

3. Which risk response involves stopping performing the risky activities? In **risk avoidance**, the activity that presents the risk is discontinued.

4. Which risk response takes measures to reduce vulnerability? In the **risk reduction response**, measures are taken to limit the impacts of the risk by reducing vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Management

According to NIST, **vulnerability management is a security practice that is designed to proactively prevent the exploitation of IT vulnerabilities that exist within an organization**. The expected result is to reduce the time and money spent dealing with vulnerabilities and the exploitation of those vulnerabilities.

Life cycle:

1. Discover: Inventory all assets across the network and identify host details, including operating systems and open services, to identify vulnerabilities. Develop a network baseline. Identify security vulnerabilities on a regular automated schedule.
2. Prioritize Assets: Categorize assets into groups or business units, and assign a business value to asset groups based on their criticality to business operations.
3. Assess: Determine a baseline risk profile to eliminate risks based on asset criticality, vulnerability, threats, and asset classification.
4. Report: Measure the level of business risk associated with your assets according to your security policies. Document a security plan, monitor suspicious activity, and describe known vulnerabilities.
5. Remediate: Prioritize according to business risk and address vulnerabilities in order of risk.
6. Verify: Verify that threats have been eliminated through follow-up audits.

### Asset Management

IST specifies in publication NISTIR 8011 Volume 2, the detailed records that should be kept for each relevant device. NIST describes potential techniques and tools for operationalizing an asset management process:

* Automated discovery and inventory of the actual state of devices
* Articulation of the desired state for those devices using policies, plans, and procedures in the organization’s information security plan
* Identification of non-compliant authorized assets
* Remediation or acceptance of device state, possible iteration of desired state definition
* Repeat the process at regular intervals, or ongoing

### Mobile Device Management

Mobile device management (MDM), especially in the age of BYOD, presents special challenges to asset management. Network administrators should assume that all mobile devices are untrusted until they have been properly secured by the organization.

### Configuration Management

Configuration management addresses the inventory and control of hardware and software configurations of systems. Secure device configurations reduce security risk. For example, an organization provides many computers and laptops to its workers. **This enlarges the attack surface for the organization, because each system may be vulnerable to exploits**.

### Enterprise Patch Management

Patch management is related to vulnerability management. Vulnerabilities frequently appear in critical client, server, and networking device operating systems and firmware. Patch management involves all aspects of software patching, including identifying required patches, acquiring, distributing, installing, and verifying that the patch is installed on all required systems. Installing patches is frequently the most effective way to mitigate software vulnerabilities. Sometimes, they are the only way to do so.

### Patch Management Techniques

1. Agent-based: This requires a software agent to be running on each host to be patched. The agent reports whether vulnerable software is installed on the host. The agent communicates with the patch management server, determines if patches exist that require installation, and installs the patches. The agent runs with sufficient privileges to allow it to install the patches. Agent-based approaches are the preferred means of patching mobile devices.
2. Agentless scanning: Patch management servers scan the network for devices that require patching. The server determines which patches are required and installs those patches on the clients. Only devices that are on scanned network segments can be patched in this way. This can be a problem for mobile devices.
3. Passive network monitoring: Devices requiring patching are identified through the monitoring of traffic on the network. This approach is only effective for software that includes version information in its network traffic.

## Information Security Management Systems

### Security Management Systems

An Information Security Management System (ISMS) consists of a management framework through which an organization identifies, analyzes, and addresses information security risks. an ISMS consists of a set of practices that are systematically applied by an organization to ensure continuous improvement in information security. **ISMSs provide conceptual models that guide organizations in planning, implementing, governing, and evaluating information security programs**.

An ISMS is a systematic, multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. The approach includes people, processes, technologies, and the cultures in which they interact in a process of risk management.

### ISO-27001

The ISO 27001 certification is a global, industry-wide specification for an ISMS.

1. Plan: Understand relevant business objectives; Define scope of activities; Access and manage support; Assess and define risk; Perform asset management and vulnerability assessment
2. Do: Create and implement risk management plan; Establish and enforce risk management policies and procedures; Train personnel, allocate resources
3. Check: Monitor implementation; Compile reports; Support external certification audit
4. Act: Continually audit processes; Continually improve processes; Take corrective action; Take preventive action

### NIST Cybersecurity 

NIST has also developed the Cybersecurity framework which is similar to the ISO/IEC 27000 standards. The NIST framework is a set of standards designed to integrate existing standards, guidelines, and practices to help better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework was first issued in February 2014 and continues to undergo development.

The framework core consists of a set of activities suggested to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes, and references examples of guidance to achieve those outcomes. The core functions, which are defined in the table, are split into major categories and subcategories.

|Core Function|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|IDENTIFY|Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities|
|PROTECT|Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services|
|DETECT|Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event|
|RESPOND|Develop and implement the appropriate activities to act on a detected cybersecurity event|
|RECOVER|Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event|

The major categories provide an understanding of the types of activities and outcomes related to each function, as shown in the next table.

|Core Function|Outcome Categories|
|-------------|------------------|
|IDENTIFY| Asset Management; Business Environment;Governance;    Risk Assessment;Risk Management Strategy|
