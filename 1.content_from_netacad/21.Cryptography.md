# Cryptography

## Integrity and Authenticity

### Securing Communications

Organizations must provide support to secure the data as it travels across links.

These are the four elements of secure communications:

* **Data Integrity**: Guarantees that the message was not altered. Any changes to data in transit will be detected. Integrity is ensured by implementing either of the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-2 or SHA-3). *The MD5 message digest algorithm is still widely in use, however it is inherently insecure and creates vulnerabilities in a network*. The use of MD5 should be avoided.
* **Origin Authentication**: Guarantees that the message is not a forgery and does actually come from whom it states. Many modern networks ensure authentication with algorithms such as hash-based message authentication code (HMAC).
* **Data Confidentiality**: Guarantees that only authorized users can read the message. If the message is intercepted, it cannot be deciphered **within a reasonable amount of time**. Data confidentiality is implemented using symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms.
* **Data Non-Repudiation**: Guarantees that the sender cannot repudiate, or refute, the validity of a message sent. Nonrepudiation relies on the fact that only the sender has the unique characteristics or signature for how that message is treated.

### Cryptographic Hash Functions

Hashes are used to verify and ensure data integrity. Hashing is based on a one-way mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute, but significantly harder to reverse. The cryptographic hashing function can also be used to verify authentication.

The cryptographic hash function is applied in many different situations for entity authentication, data integrity, and data authenticity purposes.

### MD5 and SHA

There are four well-known hash functions:

* **MD5 with 128-bit digest**: Developed by Ron Rivest and used in a variety of internet applications, MD5 is a one-way function that produces a 128-bit hashed message. MD5 is considered to be **a legacy algorithm and should be avoided and used only when no better alternatives are available**. It is recommended that SHA-2 or SHA-3 be used instead.
* **SHA-1**: Developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) in 1995. It is very similar to the MD5 hash functions. Several versions exist. SHA-1 creates a 160-bit hashed message and is slightly slower than MD5. **SHA-1 has known flaws and is a legacy algorithm**.
* **SHA-2**: Developed by the NSA. It includes SHA-224 (224 bit), SHA-256 (256 bit), SHA-384 (384 bit), and SHA-512 (512 bit). If you are using SHA-2, then the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms should be used whenever possible.
* **SHA-3**: SHA-3 is the newest hashing algorithm and was introduced by NIST as an alternative and eventual replacement for the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms. SHA-3 includes SHA3-224 (224 bit), SHA3-256 (256 bit), SHA3-384 (384 bit), and SHA3-512 (512 bit). The SHA-3 family are next-generation algorithms and should be used whenever possible.

**While hashing can be used to detect accidental changes, it cannot be used to guard against deliberate changes that are made by a threat actor. Therefore, hashing is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and does not provide security to transmitted data. To provide integrity and origin authentication, something more is required.**

**Note: Hashing algorithms only protect against accidental changes and does not protect the data from changes deliberately made by a threat actor.**

### Origin Authentication

**To add origin authentication and integrity assurance**, use a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC uses an additional secret key as input to the hash function.

**Note: Other Message Authentication Code (MAC) methods are also used. However, HMAC is used in many systems including SSL, IPsec, and SSH.**

HMAC Hashing algorithm: it's combined a cryptographic hash function with a secret key. Only the sender and the receiver know the secret key, and the output of the hash function now depends on the input data and the secret key. Only parties who have access to that secret key can compute the digest of an HMAC function. This defeats man-in-the-middle attacks and provides authentication of the data origin.

The data and the secret key are inputted in the HMAC hash function. The result is a authenticated fingerprint. It is authenticated because the secret key change the result. In a scenario where the same data is encrypted with different secret keys, the result will be different.

### Data Confidentiality

There are two classes of encryption **used to provide data confidentiality**; asymmetric and symmetric. These two classes differ in how they use keys.

**Symmetric encryption algorithms** such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) **are based on the premise that each communicating party knows the pre-shared key**. **Data confidentiality** can also be ensured **using asymmetric algorithms**, including Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) and the public key infrastructure (PKI).

**Note: DES is a legacy algorithm and should not be used. 3DES should be avoided if possible.**

Symmetric: use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data; key lengths are short (40 bits - 256 bits); faster that asymmetric encryption; commonly used for encrypting bulk data such as in VPN traffic.

Asymmetric encryption: uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data; key lengths are long (512 bits - 4096 bits); computationally taxing therefore slower than symmetric encryption; commonly used for quick data transactions such as HTTPs when accessing your bank data.

### Symmetric encryption

Symmetric algorithms use the same **pre-shared key to encrypt and decrypt data**. A pre-shared key, also called a secret key, **is known by the sender and receiver before** any encrypted communications can take place.

**Symmetric encryption algorithms are commonly used with VPN traffic**. This is because symmetric algorithms use less CPU resources than asymmetric encryption algorithms. This allows the encryption and decryption of data to be fast when using a VPN. When using symmetric encryption algorithms, like any other type of encryption, the longer the key, the longer it will take for someone to discover the key. Most encryption keys are between 112 and 256 bits. To ensure that the encryption is safe, a minimum key length of 128 bits should be used. Use a longer key for more secure communications.

**Symmetric encryption algorithms are sometimes classified as either a block cipher or a stream cipher**.

**Block ciphers** transform a fixed-length block of plaintext into a common block of ciphertext of 64 or 128 bits. Common block ciphers include DES with a 64-bit block size and AES with a 128-bit block size.

**Stream ciphers** encrypt plaintext one byte or one bit at a time. Stream ciphers are basically a block cipher with a block size of one byte or bit. **Stream ciphers are typically faster than block ciphers because data is continuously encrypted**. Examples of stream ciphers include RC4 and A5 which is used to encrypt GSM cell phone communications.

**Well-known symmetric encryption algorithms are described in the table.**

|  Symmetric Encryption Algorithms  |    Description    |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
|Data Encryption Standard (DES)     | This is a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm. It uses a short key length that makes it insecure for most current uses|
|3DES (Triple DES)                  | The is the replacement for DES and repeats the DES algorithm process three times. It should be avoided if possible as it is scheduled to be retired in 2023. If implemented, use very short key lifetimes|
|Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) | AES is a popular and recommended symmetric encryption algorithm. It offers combinations of 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys to encrypt 128, 192, or 256 bit-long data blocks|
| Software-Optimized Encryption Algorithm (SEAL) | SEAL is a faster alternative symmetric encryption algorithm to AES. SEAL is a stream cypher that uses a 160-bit encryption key and has a lower impact on the CPU compared to other software-based algorithms|
| Rivest ciphers (RC) series algorithms|This algorithm was developed by Ron Rivest. Several variations have been developed, but RC4 was the most prevalent in use. RC4 is a stream cipher that was used to secure web traffic. It has been found to have multiple vulnerabilities which have made it insecure. RC4 should not be used|

### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric algorithms, also called public-key algorithms, are designed so that the key that is used for encryption is different from the key that is used for decryption. The decryption key cannot, in any reasonable amount of time, be calculated from the encryption key and vice versa.

Asymmetric algorithms use a public key and a private key. **Both keys are capable of the encryption process, but the complementary paired key is required for decryption**. **The process is also reversible**. **Data that is encrypted with the public key requires the private key to decrypt. Asymmetric algorithms achieve confidentiality and authenticity by using this process**.

Because neither party has a shared secret, very long key lengths must be used. Asymmetric encryption can use key lengths between 512 to 4,096 bits. Key lengths greater than or equal to 2,048 bits can be trusted, while key lengths of 1,024 or shorter are considered insufficient.

Examples of protocols that use asymmetric key algorithms include:

* **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**: This is a fundamental component of IPsec VPNs.
* **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**: This is now implemented as IETF standard **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**.
* **Secure Shell (SSH)**: This protocol provides a secure remote access connection to network devices.
* **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**: This computer program provides cryptographic privacy and authentication. It is often used to increase the security of email communications. **Asymmetric algorithms are substantially slower than symmetric algorithms**. Their design is based on computational problems, such as factoring extremely large numbers or computing discrete logarithms of extremely large numbers. Because they are slow, asymmetric algorithms are typically used in low-volume cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures and key exchange. However, the key management of asymmetric algorithms tends to be simpler than symmetric algorithms, because usually one of the two encryption or decryption keys can be made public.

|Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm|Key Length|Description|
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------|
|Diffie-Hellman (DH)            |512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096|The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows two parties to agree on a key that they can use to encrypt messages they want to send to each other. The security of this algorithm depends on the assumption that it is easy to raise a number to a certain power, but difficult to compute which power was used given the number and the outcome|
|Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)| 512 - 1024|DSS specifies DSA as the algorithm for digital signatures. DSA is a public key algorithm based on the ElGamal signature scheme. Signature creation speed is similar to RSA, but is 10 to 40 times slower for verification|
|Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman encryption algorithms (RSA)|512 to 2048|RSA is for public-key cryptography that is based on the current difficulty of factoring very large numbers. It is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing, as well as encryption. It is widely used in electronic commerce protocols and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of up-to-date implementations|
|EIGamal|512 - 1024|An asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. A disadvantage of the ElGamal system is that the encrypted message becomes very big, about twice the size of the original message and for this reason it is only used for small messages such as secret keys|
|Elliptic curve techniques|224 or higher|Elliptic curve cryptography can be used to adapt many cryptographic algorithms, such as Diffie-Hellman or ElGamal. The main advantage of elliptic curve cryptography is that the keys can be much smaller|

### Asymmetric Encryption - Confidentiality

Asymmetric algorithms are used to provide confidentiality without pre-sharing a password. The confidentiality objective of **asymmetric algorithms is initiated when the encryption process is started with the public key**.

The process can be summarized using the formula: Public Key (Encrypt) + Private Key (Decrypt) = Confidentiality. When the public key is used to encrypt the data, the private key must be used to decrypt the data. Only one host has the private key; therefore, confidentiality is achieved. If the private key is compromised, another key pair must be generated to replace the compromised key.

### Asymmetric Encryption - Authentication

The authentication objective of asymmetric algorithms is initiated when the encryption process is started with the private key. The process can be summarized using the formula: Private Key (Encrypt) + Public Key (Decrypt) = Authentication. When the private key is used to encrypt the data, the corresponding public key must be used to decrypt the data. Because only one host has the private key, only that host could have encrypted the message, providing authentication of the sender. Typically, no attempt is made to preserve the secrecy of the public key, so any number of hosts can decrypt the message. When a host successfully decrypts a message using a public key, it is trusted that the private key encrypted the message, which verifies who the sender is. This is a form of authentication.

### Asymmetric Encryption - Integrity

Combining the two asymmetric encryption processes provides message confidentiality, authentication, and integrity. A message will be ciphered using Bob’s public key and a ciphered hash will be encrypted using Alice’s private key to provide confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity.

### Diffie-Hellman

Diffie-Hellman (DH) **is an asymmetric mathematical algorithm that allows two computers to generate an identical shared secret without having communicated before**. **The new shared key is never actually exchanged between the sender and receiver**. However, because both parties know it, the key can be used by an encryption algorithm to encrypt traffic between the two systems. Here are two examples of instances when DH is commonly used: Data is exchanged using an IPsec VPN; SSH data is exchanged.

The security of DH is based on the fact that it uses very large numbers in its calculations. For example, a DH 1024-bit number is roughly equal to a decimal number of 309 digits. Considering that a billion is 10 decimal digits (1,000,000,000), one can easily imagine the complexity of working with not one, but multiple 309-digit decimal numbers.

Diffie-Hellman uses different DH groups to determine the strength of the key that is used in the key agreement process. The higher group numbers are more secure, but require additional time to compute the key. The following identifies the DH groups supported by Cisco IOS Software and their associated prime number value:

* DH Group 1: 768 bits
* DH Group 2: 1024 bits
* DH Group 5: 1536 bits
* DH Group 14: 2048 bits
* DH Group 15: 3072 bits
* DH Group 16: 4096 bits

Note: A DH key agreement can also be based on elliptic curve cryptography. DH groups 19, 20, and 24, which are based on elliptic curve cryptography, are also supported by Cisco IOS Software.

Unfortunately, asymmetric key systems are extremely slow for any sort of bulk encryption. This is why it is common to encrypt the bulk of the traffic using a symmetric algorithm, such as 3DES or AES and use the DH algorithm to create keys that will be used by the encryption algorithm.
