# My errors in the Windows and Linux OS Group Exam:

## First time

**A user creates a file with .ps1 extension in Windows. What type of file is it?**

Powershell script.

[1.3.3 Windows Configuration and Monitoring]
The types of commands that PowerShell can execute include the following:

cmdlets - perform an action and return an output or object to the next command that will be executed
PowerShell scripts - files with a .ps1 extension that contain PowerShell commands that are executed
PowerShell functions - pieces of code that can be referenced in a script

**What is the purpose of using the net accounts command in Windows?**

to review the settings of password and logon requirements for users 

[1.3.3 Windows Configuration and Monitoring ]
These are some common net commands:

    net accounts – sets password and logon requirements for users
    net start – starts a network service or lists running network services
    net use – connects, disconnects, and displays information about shared network resources
    net view – shows a list of computers and network devices on the network

When used without options, the net accounts command displays the current settings for password, logon limitations, and domain information.

**A PC user issues the netstat command without any options. What is displayed as the result of this command?** 

[1.3.4 Windows Security ]
When used by itself (without any options), the netstat command will display all the active TCP connections that are available. 

**Which two methods can be used to harden a computing device? (Choose two.)**

Enforce the password history mechanism.
Ensure physical security.

[1.4.4 Basic Server Administration]
The basic best practices for device hardening are as follows:

Ensure physical security.
Minimize installed packages.
Disable unused services.
Use SSH and disable the root account login over SSH.
Keep the system updated.
Disable USB auto-detection.
Enforce strong passwords.
Force periodic password changes.
Keep users from reusing old passwords.
Review logs regularly.

**Consider the result of the ls -l command in the Linux output below. What are the file permissions assigned to the sales user for the analyst.txt file?**

read, write, execute 

[1.4.5 The Linux File System]
The file permissions are always displayed in the User, Group and Other order. In the example displayed, the file has the following permissions:

The dash ( - ) means that this is a file. For directories, the first dash would replaced with a "d".
The first set of characters is for user permission (rwx). The user, sales, who owns the file can read, write and execute the file.
The second set of characters is for group permissions (rw-). The group, staff, who owns the file can read and write to the file.
The third set of characters is for any other user or group permissions (r--). Any other user or group on the computer can only read the file.

**Which user can override file permissions on a Linux computer?**

root user

[1.4.5 The Linux File System]
A user has as much rights to a file as the f Based on the ex3 file system, an ext4 partition includes extensions that improve performance and an increase in the of supported files. An ext4 partition also supports journaling, a file system feature that minimizes the risk of file system corruption if power is suddenly lost to the system.

## Second time

**Match the Windows 10 boot sequence after the boot manager (bootmgr.exe) loads.**

order between:

The windows boot loader Winload.exe loads.
Ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll are loaded.
Winload.exe reads the Registry, chooses a hardware profile, and loads the device drivers.
Ntoskrnl.exe takes over the process.
Winlogon.exe is loaded and executes the logon process.

[1.3.2 Windows Architecture and Operations]

**A user creates a file with .ps1 extension in Windows. What type of file is it?**

**Match the commonly used ports on a Linux server with the corresponding service. (Not all options are used.)**

53, 23, 25, 443
