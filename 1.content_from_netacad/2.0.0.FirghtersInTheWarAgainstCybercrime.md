# 2 Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime

## The modern SOC: Elements of a SOC

Defending against today’s threats **requires a formalized, structured, and disciplined approach**.  **SOCs provide a broad range of services, from monitoring and management, to comprehensive threat solutions and hosted security that can be customized to meet customer needs**.

### People in the SOC

Jobs role in a SOC:

1. **Tier 1 Alert Analyst**: These professionals **monitor incoming alerts**, **verify that a true incident has occurred**, **and forward tickets to Tier 2**, **if necessary**.
2. **Tier 2 Incident Responder**: These professionals are responsible for **deep investigation of incidents and advise remediation or action to be taken**.
3. **Tier 3 Threat Hunter**: These professionals have **expert-level skill in network**, **endpoint**, **threat intelligence**, **and malware reverse engineering**. They are experts at **tracing the processes of the malware** to determine its impact and **how it can be removed**. They are also deeply involved **in hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools**. **Threat hunters search for cyber threats that are present in the network but have not yet been detected**.
4. **SOC Manager**: This professional **manages all the resources of the SOC and serves as the point of contact for the larger organization or customer**.

### Process in the SOC

The day of a Cybersecurity Analyst typically **begins with monitoring security alert queues**.

Roles of the People in a security operations center (SOC):

1. Tier 1:
    1. Monitors incidents
    2. Opens ticket
    3. Basic threat mitigation
2. Tier 2:
    1. Deep investigation
    2. Advises remediation
3. Tier 3:
    1. In-depth knowledge
    2. Threat hunting
    3. Preventive measures

### Technologies in the SOC

#### SIEM

A SOC needs a **Security Information and Event Management System**, or **SIEM**. **SIEM makes sense of all the data that firewalls, network appliances, intrusion detection systems, and other devices generate.** They are used for **collecting and filtering data**, **detecting and classifying threats**, and **analyzing and investigating threats**. SIEM systems may also manage resources to implement preventive measures and address future threats. **SOC technologies include one or more of the following**:

1. event collection, correlation, and analysis
1. security monitoring
1. security control
1. log management
1. vulnerability assessment
1. vulnerability tracking
1. threat intelligence

#### SOAR

SIEM and **security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)** are often paired together as they have **capabilities that complement each other**. **SOAR** platforms **are similar to SIEMs** in that they **aggregate**, **correlate**, and **analyze alerts**. However, **SOAR technology** goes **a step further by integrating threat intelligence** and **automating incident investigation** and **response workflows based on playbooks** **developed by the security team**.

What mean orchestration, automation and response in SOAR?

1. **Orchestration**: Creates a customized platform that integrates and coordinates numerous security tools and resources.
2. **Automation**: **Executes security processes with a minimum amount of human intervention**. Helps address the shortage in cybersecurity analyst talent and increases efficiency.
3. **Response**: Prescribes and executes security procedures to be followed in response to security events. Can be in the form of a security runbooks that consists of rule-based automated responses that were created to address specific types of events.

Soar security Platform:
1. Gather alarm data from each component of the system
1. Provide tools that enable cases to be researched, assessed, and investigated
1. Emphasize integration as a means of automating complex incident response workflows that enable more rapid response and adaptive defense strategies.
1. include pre-defined playbooks that enable automatic response to specific threats. Playbooks can be initiated automatically based on predefined rules or may be triggered by security personnel.

SOAR **emphasizes integration tools** and **automation of SOC workflows**. **It orchestrates many manual processes** such as **investigation of security alerts** only **requiring human intervention when necessary**. **This frees security personnel to address more pressing matters and high-end investigation and threat remediation**. The future adoption of sophisticated SOAR platforms will remake SOC operations and job roles.

### SOC Metrics

Five metrics are commonly used as SOC metrics. Note, however, that metrics that describe blanket performance frequently do not paint an accurate picture of SOC operation due to the diversity of cybersecurity threats. Several common metrics compiled by SOC managers are:

1. **dwell time**: the **length of time** that threat actors have access to a network **before they are detected**, and their access is stopped.
1. mean time to detect (MTTD): the average time that it takes for the SOC personnel **to identify valid security incidents** have occurred in the network.
1. mean time to respond (MTTR): the average time that it takes **to stop and remediate a security incident**.
1. mean time to contain (MTTC): the average  **time required to stop the incident** from causing further damage to systems or data.
1. time to Control: the time required **to stop the spread of malware in the network**.

## Enterprise and managed security

### Security vs. Availability

Most enterprise networks must be up and running at all times. Security personnel understand that for the organization to accomplish its priorities, **network availability must be preserved**. **A “five nines” uptime means that the network is up 99.999% of the time or down for no more than 5 minutes a year. “Four nines” would be a downtime of 53 minutes a year.**

|Availability %             |Downtime      |
|---------------------------|------------- |
|99.8%                      |17.52 hours   |
|99.9% (“three nines")      |8.76 hours    |
|99.99% (“ four nines" )    |52.56 minutes |
|99.999% (“five nines")     |5.256 minutes |
|99.9999% (“six nines“ )    |31.56 seconds |
|99.99999% (“seven nines“ ) |3.16 seconds  |
