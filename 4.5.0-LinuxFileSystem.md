## Linux File System: Types in Linux

There are many different kinds of file systems, varying in properties of speed, flexibility, security, size, structure, logic and more. It is up to the administrator to decide which file system type best suits the operating system and the files it will store.

**Big Picture about file system**

1. ext2 (second extended file system)
    * ext2 was the default file system in several major Linux distributions **until supplanted by ext3**
    * Almost fully compatible with ext2, **ext3 also supports journaling** (see below)
    * ext2 is still the file system of choice for flash-based storage media because its lack of a journal increases performance and minimizes the number of writes
    * Because flash memory devices have a limited number of write operations, minimizing write operations increases the device’s lifetime 
    * However, contemporary Linux kernels also support ext4, an even more modern file system, with better performance and which can also operate in a journal-less mode
2. ext3 (third extended file system)
    * ext3 **is a journaled file system designed to improve the existing ext2 file system**
    * A journal, the main feature added to ext3, **is a technique used to minimize the risk of file system corruption in the event of sudden power loss**
    * **The file systems keeps a log (or journal) of all the file system changes about to be made**
    * If the computer crashes before the change is complete, the journal can be used to restore or correct any eventual issues created by the crash
    * The maximum file size in ext3 file systems is 32 TB
3. ext4 (fourth extended file system)
    * Designed as a successor of ext3, ext4 was created based on a series of extensions to ext3
    * While the extensions improve the performance of ext3 and increase supported file sizes, Linux kernel developers were concerned about stability issues and were opposed to adding the extensions to the stable ext3
    * The ext3 project was split in two; one kept as ext3 and its normal development and the other, named ext4, incorporated the mentioned extensions
4. NFS (Network File System)
    * NFS is a network-based file system, allowing file access over the network
    * From the user standpoint, there is no difference between accessing a file stored locally or on another computer on the network
    * NFS is an open standard which allows anyone to implement it
5. CDFS (Compact Disc File System): CDFS was created specifically for optical disk media
6. **Swap File System**
    * The swap file system **is used by Linux when it runs out of RAM**
    * Technically, it is **a swap partition that does not have a specific file system**, but it is **relevant to the file system discussion**
    * When this happens, **the kernel moves inactive RAM content to the swap partition on the disk**
    * While swap partitions (also known as swap space) can be useful to Linux computers with a limited amount of memory, they should not be considered as a primary solution
    * Swap partition is stored on disk which has much lower access speeds than RAM
7. HFS Plus or HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus)
    * A file system used by Apple in its Macintosh computers
    * The Linux kernel includes a module for mounting HFS+ for read-write operations
8. APFS (Apple File System): An updated file system that is used by Apple devices. It provides strong encryption and is optimized for flash and solid-state drives
9.  Master Boot Record (MBR)
    * Located in the first sector of a partitioned computer, the MBR stores all the information about the way in which the file system is organized
    * The MBR quickly hands over control to a loading function, which loads the OS

Mounting is the term used for the process of assigning a directory to a partition. After a successful mount operation, the file system contained on the partition is accessible through the specified directory. In this context, the directory is called the mounting point for that file system. Windows users may be familiar with a similar concept; the drive letter.

The command output shows the output of the mount command issued in the Cisco CyberOPS VM. When issued with no options, mount returns the list of file systems currently mounted in a Linux computer. While many of the file systems shown are out of the scope of this course, notice the root file system (highlighted). **The root file system is represented by the “/” symbol and holds all files in the computer by default**. It is also shown in the output that the root file system was formatted as ext4 and occupies the first partition of the first drive (/dev/sda1).

## Linux roles and file permissions

In Linux, **most system entities are treated as files**. In order to organize the system and enforce boundaries within the computer, **Linux uses file permissions**. **File permissions are built into the file system structure and provide a mechanism to define permissions on every file**. **Every file in Linux carries its file permissions, which define the actions that the owner, the group, and others can perform with the file**. The possible permission rights are **Read, Write and Execute**. The ls command with the -l parameter lists additional information about the file.

Consider this:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l space.txt
-rwxrw-r-- 1 analyst staff 253 May 20 12:49 space.txt
 (1)      (2)   (3)   (4)   (5)     (6)       (7)
[analyst@secOps ~]$

The first field of the output displays the permissions that are associated with space.txt **(-rwxrw-r--)**. File permissions are always displayed in the User, Group, and Other order.

The file space.txt in has the following permissions:
* **The dash (-) means that this is a file**. For directories, **the first dash would be a “d”**
* **The first set of characters is** for user permission (rwx). The user, analyst, who owns the file can Read, Write and eXecute the file
* **The second set of characters is** for group permissions (rw-). The group, staff, who owns the file can Read and Write to the file
* **The third set of characters is** for any other user or group permissions (r--). Any other user or group on the computer can only Read the file

**The second field defines the number of hard links to the file (the number 1 after the permissions)**. **A hard link creates another file with a different name linked to the same place in the file system** (called an inode). This is in contrast to a symbolic link, which is discussed on the next page.

**The third and fourth field display the user (analyst) and group (staff) who own the file**, respectively.

**The fifth field displays the file size in bytes**. The space.txt file has 253 bytes.

**The sixth field displays the date and time of the last modification**.

**The seventh field displays the file name**.

**Summary about permissions**

-| rwx| rw-| r--|4.5.2 

1. file or directory bit: - indicates it is a file; d indicates it is a directory.
1. user: r w X
1. group: r w x
1. other: r w x

**Use octal values to define permissions**

|Binary|Octal|Permission|Description                |
|------|-----|----------|-----------                |
|000    |0   |---       |No access                  |
|001    |1   |--x       |Execute only               |
|010    |2   |-w-       |Write only                 |
|011    |3   |-wx       |Write and Execute          |
|100    |4   |r--       |Read only                  |
|101    |5   |r-x       |Read and Execute           |
|110    |6   |rw-       |Read and Write             |
|111    |7   |rwx       |Read, Write and Execute    |

**File permissions are a fundamental part of Linux and cannot be broken**. **A user has only the rights to a file that the file permissions allow**. The **only user that can override** file permission on a Linux computer **is the root user**.

**Because the root user has the power to override file permissions, the root user can write to any file. Because everything is treated as a file, the root user has full control over a Linux computer. Root access is often required before performing maintenance and administrative tasks. Because of the power of the root user, root credentials should use strong passwords and not be shared with anyone other than system administrators and other high-level users.**

### Hard links and symbolic links

**A hard link is another file that points to the same location as the original file**. Use the command **ln** to create a hard link. **The first argument is the existing file and the second argument is the new file**.
A symbolic link, also called a symlink or soft link, is similar to a hard link in that applying changes to the symbolic link will also change the original file. Use the **ln** command **option -s** **to create a symbolic link**.

Although symbolic links have a single point of failure (the underlying file), symbolic links have several benefits over hard links:

* Locating hard links is more difficult. Symbolic links show the location of the original file in the ls -l command, as shown in the last line of output in the previous command output (mytest.txt -> test.txt).
* Hard links are limited to the file system in which they are created. Symbolic links can link to a file in another file system.
* Hard links cannot link to a directory because the system itself uses hard links to define the hierarchy of the directory structure. However, symbolic links can link to directories.
