## Understanding the threads

Attacks are grouped in three broad categories:

1. **Reconnaissance attacks**: passive attacks used to gather information, map a network, profile the hosts, or search for vulnerabilities.
2. **Access attacks**: take advantage of vulnerabilities in order to gain access to system using techniques such as MiTM, spoofing, and social engineering.
3. **Denial-of-Service attacks**: these overwhelm a target and lock out legitimate users. Most DoS are distributed and use armies of bots or zombies to launch the attack. Zombies communicate with C&C server, which issues commands on when to launch an attack.

## Hunting threats

Cybersecurity specialists actively hunt threats with the intent of finding and rooting out potential cyberattacks.

### Stopping malicious actors

There are three separate concepts related to security:

1. security: proactive methods to protect the network
2. threat management: actively working to prevent an attack
3. forensics: reactive done after an attack

Team Approach includes:

1. In-depth knowledge of security issues and best practices for endpoint and network security
2. Data analytics and the ability to make sense of unusual patterns in the data
3. Curiosity, asking the questions: I wonder why that is there?

Planned Approach:

1. Identify the goals and the scope of the exercise
2. Uninterrupted time to invest in the hunt
3. Add the lessons you have learned to the playbook

Data is the key:

1. For any type of threat management data is the key to a successful threat hunt
2. Determine which devices that you will pull the data
3. Have enough logging capability to carry out the hunt so you can see the activity
