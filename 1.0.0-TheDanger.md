# 1 The Danger

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.0.1 First Time in This Course

CyberOps Associate **covers knowledge and skills** needed to successfully handle the tasks, duties, and **responsibilities of an associate-level Security Analyst working in a Security Operations Center (SOC)**.

The responsibilities are:
1. Install virtual machines to create a safe environment for implementing and analyzing cybersecurity threat events
1. Explain the role of the Cybersecurity Operations Analyst in the enterprise
1. Explain the Windows Operating System features and characteristics needed to support cybersecurity analyses
1. Explain the features and characteristics of the Linux Operating System
1. Analyze the operation of network protocols and services
1. Explain the operation of the network infrastructure
1. Classify the various types of network attacks
1. Use network monitoring tools to identify attacks against network protocols and services
1. Explain how to prevent malicious access to computer networks, hosts, and data
1. Explain the impacts of cryptography on network security monitoring
1. Explain how to investigate endpoint vulnerabilities and attacks
1. Evaluate network security alerts
1. Analyze network intrusion data to identify compromised hosts and vulnerabilities
1. Apply incident response models to manage network security incidents

## 1.0.3 Ethical Hacking Statement

Training to become a cybersecurity specialist requires in depth understanding and exposure to how cyber attacks occur, as well as how they are detected and prevented. Security holes and vulnerabilities that are created in this course should only be used in an ethical manner and only in this "sandboxed" virtual environment.


## 1.1.1 Hijacked People

**Rogue** wireless hotspots, as well known "evil twin" is a technique that a hacker set up an open "rogue" wireless hotspot posing as another, like a coffee shop's wireless network. When someone logged onto her bank's website, for instance, the hacker hijacked her session and gained access to her bank accounts.

## 1.1.2 Ransomed Companies

**Curiosity** is a flaw that drive someone to open an email and click in an unknown attachment.The same scenario plays out across the organization as dozens of other employees are successfully enticed to click the attachment. When the PDF opens, ransomware is installed on the employees’ computers and begins the process of gathering and encrypting corporate data. The goal of the attackers is financial gain, because they hold the company’s data for ransom until they are paid.

## 1.1.3 Targeted Nations

Such malware can be targeted to attack a nation’s vulnerable infrastructure, such as the water system or power grid.

This was the purpose of the Stuxnet worm, which infected USB drives. These drives were carried by five Iranian component vendors into a secure facility that they supported. Stuxnet was designed to infiltrate Windows operating systems and then target Step 7 software. Step 7 was developed by Siemens for their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Stuxnet was looking for a specific model of the Siemens PLCs that controls the centrifuges in uranium processing facilities. The worm was transmitted from the infected USB drives into the PLCs and eventually damaged many of these centrifuges.

**Zero Days**, a film released in 2016, documents what is known about the development and deployment of the Stuxnet targeted malware attack. Search for Zero Days to find the film or information about the film.


## 1.2 Threat Actors

### 1.2.1 Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups of individuals who perform cyberattacks. Cyberattacks are intentional malicious acts meant to negatively impact another individual or organization.

At least there are five threat actors

* amateurs
* hacktivists
* organized crime groups
* state-sponsored
* terrorist groups

1. Amateurs: also known as script kiddies, have little or no skill. Generally they use tools or instructions found on the internet to launch attacks.
1. Hacktivists: they are hackers who protest against a variety of political and social ideas. Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by posting articles and videos, leaking sensitive information, and disrupting web services with illegitimate traffic in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
1. Financial Gain: Much of the hacking activity that consistently threatens our security is motivated by financial gain. These cybercriminals want to gain access to our bank accounts, personal data, and anything else they can leverage to generate cash flow.
1. Trade secrets and global politics: In the past several years, we have heard many stories about nation states hacking other countries, or otherwise interfering with internal politics. Nation states are also interested in using cyberspace for industrial espionage. The theft of intellectual property can give a country a significant advantage in international trade. Defending against the fallout from state-sponsored cyberespionage and cyberwarfare will continue to be a priority for cybersecurity professionals.

### 1.2.2 How secure is the internet of things (IoT)?

* How secure are these devices? 
* For example, who wrote the firmware? 
* Did the programmer pay attention to security flaws? 
* Is your connected home thermostat vulnerable to attacks? 
* What about your digital video recorder (DVR)? 
* If security vulnerabilities are found, can firmware in the device be patched to eliminate the vulnerability?

In October 2016, **a DDoS attack** against the domain name provider Dyn took down many popular websites. The attack came **from a large number of webcams, DVRs, routers, and other IoT devices** that had been compromised by malicious software. **These devices formed a “botnet”** that was controlled by hackers. This botnet was used to create an enormous DDoS attack that disabled essential internet services. Dyn has posted a blog to explain the attack and their reaction to it. Search on “Dyn Analysis Summary of Friday October 21 Attack” to learn more about this record-breaking attack.

For an explanation of the dangers of not securing IoT devices, search for Avi Rubin’s TED talk, “All Your Devices can be Hacked.” Dr. Rubin is a Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University.

## Threat Impact

### 1.3.1 PII, PHI, and PSI

Some lingo:

1. PII or Personally Identifiable Information: it is any information that can be used to positively identify an individual:

* name
* social security number
* birthday
* credit card numbers
* bank account numbers
* government issue ID
* address information (street, email, phone numbers)

One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be sold on the dark web.

1. PHI or Protected health information: it is a subnet of PII. The medical community creates and maintains electronic medical records (EMRs) that contain PHI. In the U.S., handling of PHI is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (**HIPAA**). In the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**) protects a broad range of personal information in including health records.
1. PSI or Personal Security Information: it is another type of PII. This information includes usernames, passwords, and other security-related information that individuals use to access information or services on the network.
