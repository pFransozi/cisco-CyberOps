# 4.0.0 Linux

## 4.7.0 Working on a linux host

### 4.0.1 Installing and running applications on a Linux Host

Package managers vary depending on Linux distributions. For example, **pacman** is used by Arch Linux while **dpkg** (Debian package) and **apt** (Advanced Packaging Tool) are used in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions. For this course, we will use the pacman package manager.

### Keeping the system up to date

Also known as patches, OS updates are released periodically by OS companies to address any known vulnerabilities in their operating systems. While companies have update schedules, the release of unscheduled OS updates can happen when a major vulnerability is found in the OS code. Modern operating systems will alert the user when updates are available for download and installation, but the user can check for updates at any time.

* install a package by name
    * arch: pacman -S
    * apt install
* remove a package by name
    * pacman -Rs
    * apt remove
* update a local package
    * pacman -Syy
    * apt-get update
* upgrade all currently installed packages
    * pacman -Syu
    * apt-get upgrade

### process and forks

**A process is a running instance of a computer program. Multitasking operating systems can execute many processes at the same time**.

**Forking is a method that the kernel uses to allow a process to create a copy of itself. Processes need a way to create new processes in multitasking operating systems. The fork operation is the only way of doing so in Linux.**

Forking is important for many reasons. One of them relates to process scalability. Apache, a popular web server, is a good example. By forking itself, Apache is able to serve a large number of requests with fewer system resources than a single-process-based server.

When a process calls a fork, the caller process becomes the parent process, with the newly created process referred to as its child. After the fork, the processes are, to some extent, independent processes; they have different process IDs but run the same program code.

Three commands that are used to manage processes.

* **ps**:
    * Used to list the processes running on the computer at the time it is invoked. 
    * It can be instructed to display running processes that belong to the current user or other users. 
    * While listing processes does not require root privileges, killing or modifying other user’s processes does.
* **top**:  
    * Used to list running processes, but unlike ps, top keeps displaying running processes dynamically. 
    * Press q to exit top.
* **kill**: 
    * Used to modify the behavior of a specific process. 
    * Depending on the parameters, kill will remove, restart, or pause a process. 
    * In many cases, the user will run ps or top before running kill. 
    * This is done so the user can learn the PID of a process before running kill.

### 4.7.4 Malware on a Linux Host.

Linux malware includes viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and other types of malware that can affect the operating system. Due to a number of design components such as file system structure, file permissions, and user account restrictions, Linux operating systems are generally regarded as better protected against malware. **While arguably better protected, Linux is not immune to malware**.

### 4.7.5 Rootkit check

A rootkit is a type of malware that is designed to increase an unauthorized user’s privileges or grant access to portions of the software that should not normally be allowed. Rootkits are also often used to secure a backdoor to a compromised computer.

chkrootkit is a popular Linux-based program designed to check the computer for known rootkits. It is a shell script that uses common Linux tools such as strings and grep to compare the signatures of core programs. It also looks for discrepancies as it traverses the /proc file system comparing the signatures found there with the output of ps.

### 4.7.6 Piping commands

Although command line tools are usually designed to perform a specific, well-defined task, many commands can be combined to perform more complex tasks by a technique known as piping. Named after its defining character, the pipe (|), piping consists of chaining commands together, feeding the output of one command into the input of another.

or example, the ls command is used to display all the files and directories of a given directory. The grep command compares searches through a file or text looking for the specified string. If found, grep displays the entire contents of the folder where the string was found.

The two commands, ls and grep, can be piped together to filter out the output of ls. This is shown in the output of the ls -l | grep host command and the ls -l | grep file command.
