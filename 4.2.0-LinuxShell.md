## Working in the Linux Shell

### 4.2.1 The linux shell

In Linux, the user communicates with the OS by using **the CLI or the GUI**. 

### Basic commands

Linux commands are programs created to perform a specific task. Use the man command (short for manual) to obtain documentation about commands.

Because commands are programs stored on the disk, when a user types a command, the shell must find it on the disk before it can be executed. **The shell will look for user-typed commands in specific directories and attempt to execute them**.

**The list of directories checked by the shell is called the path. The path contains many directories commonly used to store commands. If a command is not in the path, the user must specify its location, or the shell will not be able to find it. Users can easily add directories to the path, if necessary.** **To invoke a command via the shell, simply type its name. The shell will try to find it in the system path and execute it.**

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|mv     |Moves or renames files and directories|
|chmod  |Modifies file permissions|
|chown  |Changes the ownership of a file|
|dd     |Copies data from an input to an output|
|pwd    |Displays the name of the current directory|
|ps     |Lists the processes that are currently running in the system|
|su     |Simulates a login as another user or to become a superuser|
|sudo   |Runs a command as a super user, by default, or another named user|
|grep   |Used to search for specific strings of characters within a file or other command outputs. To search through the output of a previous command, grep must be piped at the end of the previous command.|
|ifconfig|Used to display or configure network card related information. If issued without parameters, ifconfig will display the current network card(s) configuration. Note: While still widely in use, this command is deprecated. Use ip address instead.|
|apt-get|Used to install, configure and remove packages on Debian and its derivatives. Note: apt-get is a user-friendly command line front-end for dpkg, Debianâ€™s package manager. The combo dpkg and apt-get is the default package manager system in all Debian Linux derivatives, including Raspbian.|
|iwconfig|Used to display or configure wireless network card related information. Similar to ifconfig, iwconfig will display wireless information when issued without parameters.|
|shutdown|Shuts down the system, shutdown can be instructed to perform a number of shut down related tasks, including restart, halt, put to sleep or kick out all currently connected users.|
|passwd|Used to change the password. If no parameters are provided, passwd changes the password for the current user.|
|cat|Used to list the contents of a file and expects the file name as the parameter. The cat command is usually used on text files.|
|man|Used to display the documentation for a specific command|

### File and directory commands

**Big Picture of the most common commands related to files and directories**

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|ls     |Displays the files inside a directory |
|cd     |Changes the current directory |
|mkdir  |Creates a directory under the current directory |
|cp     |Copies files from source to destination |
|mv     |Moves files to a different directory |
|rm     |Removes files|
|grep   |Searches for specific strings of characters within a file or other commands outputs |
|cat    |Lists the contents of a file and expects the file name as the parameter|

### 4.2.4 Working with text files

Nano.

### 4.2.5 The importance of text files in linux.

**In Linux, everything is treated as a file**. This includes the memory, the disks, the monitor, and the directories. For example, from the operating system standpoint, showing information on the display means to write to the file that represents the display device. **It should be no surprise that the computer itself is configured through files.**

Users with proper permission levels can use text editors to change the contents of configuration files. After the changes are made, the file is saved and can be used by the related service or application. Users are able to specify exactly how they want any given application or service to behave. When launched, services and applications check the contents of specific configuration files to adjust their behavior accordingly.
